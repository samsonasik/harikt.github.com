    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Saturday April 10th 2010 , two big events are going to happen in Kerala . If you were following me in twitter you may have noticed it . 1 ) Google Technology User's Group and 2 ) The Adobe Users Group launch event .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497299898/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4497299898_9872bb6922.jpg" alt="Google Technology Users Group Launch Event at Technopark" /></a>  I am Happy that kerala is also getting some user groups . Previously Bangalore was the hub and now we can see small groups peeping here and there all over kerala. The GTUG event venue is UST Global6th Floor (Zentith Hall) ,Bhavani,Technopark , Trivandrum. Timing is between 10 AM to 1 PM .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497302818/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4497302818_ffcec8241d.jpg" alt="Adobe Kerla Users Group Launch Event at Cochin" /></a>  Adobe Users Group Launch event is at Woods Manor Hotel , Cochin. I loved to attend both the events , but both on the same day at different locations . Though I am at cochin I will be moving to technopark , Trivandrum for the GTUG launch event. If you was following me , you may have seen my tweet some days back. I am little late to post in my blog due to certain reasons. The seats for both the events are limited and for the GTUG I think its almost finished . I am not sure about the Adobe event . So you guys can look both the events and can be part of your loving group . You can get more details about Adobe Users Group from <a href="http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/">http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/</a> and the Kerala Google Technology Users group from <a href="http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/">http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/</a></p>
