    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are using a limited band width Internet then you may have thought of downloading the youtube videos to your system . Else this is not a big deal . I have searched a lot how to download youtube videos in a single click. Some doesn't works at all. But after a lots of search and all , one of my friend , Krissy of the phpdirector development team helped me to host one for you .  Yes, its totally free , in just simple clicks you can download youtube videos . Before that I was using the one addon with the mozilla . But adding more addons some times makes bug to the browser itself. So its not a good one I think . Its my opinion only. You can do what ever you wish .  Some of the reasons that I want to download it is for  1 ) Have a limited band width internet connection  2 ) Can watch the video even there is no internet  3 ) When the speed of internet is slow , you dont want to bother at all .  It has 3 different formats .  1 ) FLV  2 ) MP4  3 ) 3GP  If you are downloading it for mobile use 3GP . If you need a video with high quality go for mp4 .  Here is the link to <a href="http://harikt.com/youtube/" title="Download youtube videos">http://harikt.com/youtube/</a> download the videos.</p>
