    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday my friend Jithesh called me . He used to call me , but today he was having a doubt also .  "Will I get some money from online jobs ?I have seen various places about data entry , google kit etc . Whats this man ? "  So I thought of wrting about it . If you are interested here it is  You too can earn . But read completely with some patience<img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . The one source that I am pretty sure is <strong>google</strong> gives you money .  <strong>Now you may be thinking why google needs to pay you money?</strong>  They pay you the money for the advertisement or the ads they are showing in your site .  <strong>What do you mean by a site ?</strong>  A site is some place where you place some contents to the public. For eg : harikt.com is a site .Yahoo , AOL , Rediff etc .  <strong>How can I get a site ?</strong>  Now there are lots of free hosting services . <a href="http://pages.google.com/" title="Google Page Creator">Googles page creator</a> , <a href="http://blogger.com/" title="Blog of Google">Blogger</a> by google , <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">yahoo geocities</a> etc are some services. I prefer you googles page creator or blogger . Geocities will add their own ads. But googles services like blogger and page creator is ads free . They host it freely . You need only a gmail account to start it . Blogger is a nice one , if you dont know much html . You don't want to bother about the html and all . Its simple as you send a mail. I suggest blogger for those who are unfamiliar about html .  You can also go for a paid hosting and get a domain name . If you are not familiar about it the best one is to get a blogger account and slowly you will learn.  <strong>My site is ready . What should I do next ?</strong>  Register for <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" title="Google Adsense">google adsense program</a> . You can register with your gmail ID . If you are using blogger , then you can affiliate to google adsense from there . Else you can login to your adsense account get the code which suits the correct position , width , height and place there.  <strong>How to make your site popular ?</strong>  Announce your site . Let your friends come and visit your site and if the contents of the page helps them , they will recommend to their friends and the number of visitors increase . Dont bother about the payment and all . Write relevant posts . Google itslef will find your site in their search .  <strong>When will I receive my payment ?</strong>  After your account reaches 50$ they will send you the code for verification of your identity . You just need to login and give the identity number . When your acoount reaches $100 the payment is ready . You can hold the payment or they will send you the money in their next month . Have it cheers ....  <strong>Is this all true ? Have you received any ?</strong>  :) . When I started my google adsense I used to tell my friends to visit my site . There was no relevant contents in my site. But after that I started my blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/" title="Blog of Hari">http://www.ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> . Some of them was useful to others. People came to my blog . Some of my friends called me $ ( dollar ) those time . I was not sure at that time whether I will receive it or not ? So I was not able to quarrel with them. But when I got the confirmation code I was some what sure that this will work .  Finally I was successful and I am receiving my $$$$$$$$$$$ .<img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> Some of my old frineds have started adsense now . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . Now they know I am successful. Thanks to google .  <strong>Do you know any other source ?</strong>  Yahoo , adbard.net also is having adsense program . I have not tried all that . So I cant guarantee you .  Mail your friends about this . Let them too learn and earn .  * Note Things you must remember  Never click your ads ..Before joining please read more about googe adsense from their help .  This article will be edited to include a more detailed view. So stay tuned . I will teach you to earn more $$$ than me <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" />  If you find this article please spend some time to add your comments or digg it.</p>
