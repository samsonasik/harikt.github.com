    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even if you have Windows, sometimes you may be facing the same problem. You may need to check IE 6 , 7 , 8 . I used to work from GNU / Linux . But recently I came to a site which gives the live screenshots of the webpages in different operating systems with different browsers . This made me think how it works :) .  Yes its easy to implement it . You just need a Windows machine with IE6 , another with IE7 , and IE8 . So now it has 3 machines with 3 IE versions . You can either login to the other machine using the remote desktop and check the browser compatibility there .  This is also a cheapest way to reduce the cost of developement according to me . By this way every one can login to their GNU/Linux machine and login to remote desktop to test the IE versions . Windows 7 comes with some , and I have heard that there is some softwares also to make IE 6, 7, 8 work on a single machine . But I am not much aware of  the softwares as I don't have a Windows running in mine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I welcome any of the windows users to come and contribute to this . I will be much more happier to hear from you . You can write the comments <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> and let me know what you think .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Internet Explorer is always a pain for developers and web designers. Many of the functions are not recognised by IE . Some people who loves the buggy browser still uses it . There are lots of features and security available in Mozilla. Don't know why some people still stick onto it . Aaah its upto them .  I was looking for a solution for the IE6 bug . The bug was the select box is pocking through the javascript menu . All the other elements excpet the select box will come on the top :( . I want to make it clear. Spend a lot of time to get a solution for it. Finally I was successful .  This was the solution  Need to load the menu above an iframe .Referring the site w3schools I got some helps too . We need to make the z-index of menu 1 more than that of iframe. That is when z-index of iframeis 1, z-index of menu should be 2 or more. The default z-index will be 0 . z-index -1 has lower priority . The z-index property will be availale only when position:absolute is defined for it. When position:absolute is used , there will be some design issues arrising and you need to over come these .  <iframe name="iframeblocker" id="iframeblocker" src="" style="position:absolute; z-index:1; border:0; height:200px; width:50px; top:-1000px; left:-1000px;"\>&lt;/iframe>  So we can make the iframe visible by making the changes to x, y co-ordinates. You need to make the changes through DOM .  $blocker = document.getElementById('iframebblocker');  blocker.style.left = document.getElementById('MenuDiv').offsetLeft; // IE only  blocker.style.top = document.getElementById('MenuDiv').offsetTop; // IE only  blocker.style.width = document.getElementById('MenuDiv').offsetWidth;  blocker.style.height = document.getElementById('MenuDiv').offsetHeight;  The above code should be made available in the javascript menu . You can look the code where its saying to show the menu and hide. On hiding you can set the left , top , width and height to 0px. Else the iframe will be visible blocking other contents . The MenuDiv is the ID of the menu . We need to get the exact width , height , x and y c0-ordinate to show the iframe exactly below the menu . Else the iframe will be wide covering other values of the page.  Some of the features where IE specific. I have referred a lots of site , to fix this problem . Now I can handle this bug. This post is to make me remember how to solve this bug.</p>
