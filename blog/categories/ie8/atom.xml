    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are a web-developer or having some exposure to computers will be knowing which one is the worlds most trusted secure browser .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4561079656/" title="chrome by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3410/4561079656_6a58fe4f79.jpg" alt="chrome" /></a>  Today I saw an advertisement when I was looking in.msn.com in google chrome, mozilla firefox etc . Seems funny and its really funny that their site scrolls up and never ends in their own browser ie8 which claims as the most secure browser. Oh sorry it never says its the most wonderful browser that renders properly :P , just says its the secure browser , but do you remember why google closed their china office? Great secure browser <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4560434483/" title="ie8 by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/4560434483_1b62d7e4f6.jpg" alt="ie8" /></a>  You can see from the above picture how IE 8 is rendering when you scroll down . I don't think , at any point the scrolling ends <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Microsoft please fix that , I love to see it fixed . As its an advertisement they can show its the most secure browser , but how many of you will trust it ? Open-source browser's rocks and Firefox super rocks . Many seems interested in chrome too for the wonderful look and feel ( Chrome is free ) which was modified from the chromium open-source project hosted by google. Web is going with open-standards and please don't stop it moving forward with any more browser like IE6 . I heard IE 9 is pretty good, and have seen the site with the report and nice to see that you are much infront . But I am not sure whether all are correct too :) . Let's make the web as an operating system independet , cross browser compatible . Good luck guys to all in w3c .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even if you have Windows, sometimes you may be facing the same problem. You may need to check IE 6 , 7 , 8 . I used to work from GNU / Linux . But recently I came to a site which gives the live screenshots of the webpages in different operating systems with different browsers . This made me think how it works :) .  Yes its easy to implement it . You just need a Windows machine with IE6 , another with IE7 , and IE8 . So now it has 3 machines with 3 IE versions . You can either login to the other machine using the remote desktop and check the browser compatibility there .  This is also a cheapest way to reduce the cost of developement according to me . By this way every one can login to their GNU/Linux machine and login to remote desktop to test the IE versions . Windows 7 comes with some , and I have heard that there is some softwares also to make IE 6, 7, 8 work on a single machine . But I am not much aware of  the softwares as I don't have a Windows running in mine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I welcome any of the windows users to come and contribute to this . I will be much more happier to hear from you . You can write the comments <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> and let me know what you think .</p>
