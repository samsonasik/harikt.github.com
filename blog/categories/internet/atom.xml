    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was introduced to the world of Internet after my 10th standard examination. Was not having a computer at home, so just browse a few hours a month or around 6 month time. But later when I got my first AMD Athlon ( When I am doing my BTech in IT) , I got a start-up pack. From there onwards I am addicted to computers and internet. I hope its not me now , but the whole world is addicted either with social media websites or something like me :) . So we need a good internet provider. I do have a BSNL landline 500 C plan, which I use less as I move from Cochin , Trivandrum, Bangalore , Chennai etc . I have been using BSNL EVDO which offers a 2Mbps connection ( I bought the device for 4500 :P ) . When I was taking the connection was better, but later I feel due to the introduction of BSNL 3G the poor connectivity and resolving issues was high. The customer service is a hell and I was trying to switch to a 3G connection for I want to buy the device only once or I can use my Samsung Galaxy Android set ;) . Looking for a 3G provider in my locality I came to know that the only one currently is BSNL . Aaah hell , the first thing came to me :) . Today I went to buy a SIM to try different 2G and 3G speeds. The first one I tried currently is Vodafone. I was offered the system to have a look into the demo. Great , and I did some testing Tested Vodafone in Calicut : 1 ) Going for google.com :) . 2 ) speedtest.net 3 ) Opening 2 terminals Start -> Run -> CMD {syntaxhighlighter BASH} ping -t google.com tracert google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} I am big fan of *nix systems . But the one which is provided for demo is Windows ie why the commands :) . For people who want to try in *nix From terminal {syntaxhighlighter BASH} $ traceroute google.com $ ping google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} Why I put a ping -t is for continous ping for windows. Else it will stop after 4 pings . Speedtest for vodafone 3G was impressive . I don't remember the exact time , but download was around 2 Mps I guess and Upload of .11 Mbps ( Sorry if it was wrong ) But tracert and ping was taking more time :( . Anyway I thought of buying a SIM and go for a test from my home. Got one , charged for 2G plan , connected :D . Oh horrible . Changed DNS from googles, 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 and open-dns 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 . Oh my hm . But the one of the most impressive thing is just on a tweet they are ready to know and help. That's a caring customer service . Hands of to that , that's impressive . So I am searching for a good internet provider, and you may already have seen lots of posts on the blog http://ijust4u.blogspot.com . But writing this post here is I have more visitors to this website than the other and if you are not subscribed to the other one I will never get an answer for my Question. Please do the ping and tracert commands from Windows . Ctrl + C to exit ping , let it take ping for 10-20 minutes . Please share the screen shots some where and comment on the post with the links . Lets find the best provider which can server internet . I am not looking for Reliance connect , Tata Photon like services for I want to buy the device and also its not available in Kunnamangalam also its a lock as I suffer now with the EVDO 4500 gone :) . So you can check in 2G mode or in 3G do let me know . Thanks</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2509/4005823080_2cddac3e94_m.jpg" alt="Secure network" />After the session by Manu Zacharia ( An ISO 27001-2005 lead auditor , Director Information Security ... ) from Barcamp 6, I thought of looking closely my system and who all are trying to get into the system. Yes, he was correct . We can see the attempts from different IP's and I just looked to get the details of the IP address .  Many of the IP's which where in the events blocked where from New Delhi and the ISP was BSNL . I don't even know whether these guys are crackers or not . Some of the IP's that where reported in the blocked events where from Singapore too .( Not looked all the IP details and events ).  I was wondering about the case of common people who don't know much about the problems and attacks like this . Is their network secure ? Even though there is good administrators , the many portals are cracked. So guys, go for open-source products , so the code is open and you can check , rather than getting a free or shareware softwares and asking a cracker to enter in your system . Be secured with some great firewall .  Don't go for a properitery firewall, go for opensource . Once again I am remembering you . I am planning to learn something about the security system , so that it will help me in the webdevelopment to make it much more secure than what I know now. I think every coder must learn how attacks are happening than just writing some code for money, so can make the things much more secure. We all know about XSS attack and many sites are being attacked each day now too. Why its so ? Is the coder aware how to secure it ? Yes the first thing is to learn about the attack and how its happening and then we have to stop anymore attacks like it in the future. So according to me, I think a coder must learn about security systems.</p>

    <link href="http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/01/27/earn-money/"/>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/01/27/earn-money</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday my friend Jithesh called me . He used to call me , but today he was having a doubt also .  "Will I get some money from online jobs ?I have seen various places about data entry , google kit etc . Whats this man ? "  So I thought of wrting about it . If you are interested here it is  You too can earn . But read completely with some patience<img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . The one source that I am pretty sure is <strong>google</strong> gives you money .  <strong>Now you may be thinking why google needs to pay you money?</strong>  They pay you the money for the advertisement or the ads they are showing in your site .  <strong>What do you mean by a site ?</strong>  A site is some place where you place some contents to the public. For eg : harikt.com is a site .Yahoo , AOL , Rediff etc .  <strong>How can I get a site ?</strong>  Now there are lots of free hosting services . <a href="http://pages.google.com/" title="Google Page Creator">Googles page creator</a> , <a href="http://blogger.com/" title="Blog of Google">Blogger</a> by google , <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">yahoo geocities</a> etc are some services. I prefer you googles page creator or blogger . Geocities will add their own ads. But googles services like blogger and page creator is ads free . They host it freely . You need only a gmail account to start it . Blogger is a nice one , if you dont know much html . You don't want to bother about the html and all . Its simple as you send a mail. I suggest blogger for those who are unfamiliar about html .  You can also go for a paid hosting and get a domain name . If you are not familiar about it the best one is to get a blogger account and slowly you will learn.  <strong>My site is ready . What should I do next ?</strong>  Register for <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" title="Google Adsense">google adsense program</a> . You can register with your gmail ID . If you are using blogger , then you can affiliate to google adsense from there . Else you can login to your adsense account get the code which suits the correct position , width , height and place there.  <strong>How to make your site popular ?</strong>  Announce your site . Let your friends come and visit your site and if the contents of the page helps them , they will recommend to their friends and the number of visitors increase . Dont bother about the payment and all . Write relevant posts . Google itslef will find your site in their search .  <strong>When will I receive my payment ?</strong>  After your account reaches 50$ they will send you the code for verification of your identity . You just need to login and give the identity number . When your acoount reaches $100 the payment is ready . You can hold the payment or they will send you the money in their next month . Have it cheers ....  <strong>Is this all true ? Have you received any ?</strong>  :) . When I started my google adsense I used to tell my friends to visit my site . There was no relevant contents in my site. But after that I started my blog <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/" title="Blog of Hari">http://www.ijust4u.blogspot.com</a> . Some of them was useful to others. People came to my blog . Some of my friends called me $ ( dollar ) those time . I was not sure at that time whether I will receive it or not ? So I was not able to quarrel with them. But when I got the confirmation code I was some what sure that this will work .  Finally I was successful and I am receiving my $$$$$$$$$$$ .<img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> Some of my old frineds have started adsense now . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . Now they know I am successful. Thanks to google .  <strong>Do you know any other source ?</strong>  Yahoo , adbard.net also is having adsense program . I have not tried all that . So I cant guarantee you .  Mail your friends about this . Let them too learn and earn .  * Note Things you must remember  Never click your ads ..Before joining please read more about googe adsense from their help .  This article will be edited to include a more detailed view. So stay tuned . I will teach you to earn more $$$ than me <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" />  If you find this article please spend some time to add your comments or digg it.</p>
