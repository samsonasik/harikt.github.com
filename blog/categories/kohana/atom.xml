    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some weeks back I finished the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/kohana-3-0-for-professional-web-applications-beginners-guide/book">Kohana 3.0 Beginner's Guide</a>. As the name suggests its so simple that anyone new to PHP can learn Kohana. Yes I recommend learning a framework if you are a PHP Developer . It has lots of advantages, that you will come across in your development life.( Not going deep on it ) . The author of the book is Jason D. Straughan, published by Packt. As a reviewer I must be open, so its open from the mind. I love packt and have no issues with the author ( I don't know him personally nor have any grudge ), but for a buyer its not like that. So forgive me. I started reading the book with a great enthusiasm, though its not a 5.3 framework, but to learn the principles and learn the good things of HMVC. Its annoying for a newbie if you see some errata's even though he doesn't know its an errata. The single quotes and double quotes have issues almost many parts of the book. Yes we can say the books code is online, so correction is easy. So I am not talking anymore about the Errata's . Because there are some :), may be due to the format issues arised when sending back and forth . The book talks about Kohana version 3.0. But the current version is 3.2 . There is compatibility issues with 3.2, 3.0 . Not sure about 3.1 though . I played downloading 3.2 and I was stuck. The books page 312 mentions about the support for each release . So after each 6 months new versions will come and the support is for 1 year. Around the 5th chapter it introduce the ORM used in Kohana and I loved that chapter . The missing things I love to see in the book are Ajax support, or how ajax support is achieved, named routing. ie without the module/controller/action/id stuffs. This is always the default one. As its a hard to do with an open-source book to maintain the pace the code is pumped I feel Packt want to follow the way http://progit.org/ . So a book for the community and will be brought by people , so always upto date and correct . Writing a book is hard, but for a reader he must not be aware, but just the contents . Download Sample Chapter : http://bit.ly/qT14Hi Beginner Level Programmer ( Ignoring Errata ) : 3 / 5 Moderate Developer Rate : 2 / 5 . Personal Opinion is Packt should take much more seriousness before publishing open-source books for the life span of writing the book may go and the software may have started another version. Also there are a lots of good books by Packt, which are being burried due to the opinions people raising against the low quality books like this. Feel free to correct me, always good to get in touch with the open-source community leader and ask suggestions before jumping to publish a book. You have some good stuffs missing like Mongo , Couch , Developing a multilingual website from scratch etc. Great topics on the list . On Symfony2 Beginners guide , Advanced and lots :) . Don't dump it, colloborate and bring it we are waiting :) .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/12/22/node-120</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957465/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4205957465_0c3be9763b.jpg" alt="kohana by K T Hari, on Flickr" /></a>I have heard about Kohana before too, but have not looked into it . But today I understood the fact that Kohana is a PHP 5 MVC framework and is a fork of Codeigniter.  Kohana follows strict OOP concepts . I have to admit that Zend has great libraries for Webservices and it will defnitely improve . So what importing the Zend libraries ? Yes you can <a href="http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/libraries">import zend framework libraries in Kohana</a> . Another thing is Kohana uses swiftmailer , the PHP mail library .  You may have thought why I was attracted with in a few minutes looking Kohana right ? If so then I think you want to look into the <a href="http://www.dealtaker.com/blog/2009/11/20/kohana-php-3-0-ko3-tutorial-part-1/">tutorial of Kohana 3</a> which is under development . Zend framework may need the examples like the above ones , you may wonder at seeing some documentation where to keep this and how it works etc . I sometimes even remebered reading some books from page 80 asking us to look page 480 for more details. On page 480 it may be telling about some other chapters . Kohana is not using unit testing . So if you are a big fan of unit tests , then you may want to look other frameworks like Zend, Symfony etc .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg" alt="Lithium PHP 5 framework" /></a>That's all about Kohana . This is about the new born PHP 5.3 framework Lithium. I don't know whether you have heard about the Lithium project . It was announced after zend-con . I have heard the podcasts in php architect some long days back .  Lithium uses PHP 5.3 and is a RAD framework. The project is brought to you by cakephp guys, not just cake guys , but some others too . Lithium can be used on servers who supports PHP version 5.3 . Its in the development stage. You can see more details from <a href="http://li3.rad-dev.org/">http://li3.rad-dev.org/</a> . I remember the tweet by Nate Abele  promising Li3 will have a stable release before Solar. This promise was made after Nate says <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/6275380270">to codeigniter guys</a> "Dear #CodeIgniter People, Don't you care that it's almost 2010 and you're still running PHP4 code? Yours, - Nate" and he got a <a href="http://twitter.com/enygma/status/6275503250">reply from Chris Cornutt</a> of <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> "@nateabele it's okay...we only have two more years until the world ends. Will Lithium have a stable release before then? ;)" . So you can see another wonderful PHP 5 strict OOP based framework soon . Explore the development versions to keep in touch with it.  Update : Lithium PHP framework development is going too fast. Now the version <del>0.5</del> 0.6 has been released ie they have gone more than half way . Some of the features are missing, but you can see those missing features in the coming versions . Also I have seen some of the projects started using lithium . Some of the zend framework developers also have joined the Lithium project . Don't remember the sites I have seen . If any of you are from Lithium reading this post, add your comments . If any trouble ( goo the project leader was telling about the problem with mollom ) just mail to me .  For more details about the versions you can see <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions">http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions</a> . You can see how fast its moving .</p>
