    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4408541076/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4408541076_af0003409b_o.gif" alt="Barcamp Kerala" /></a>  Finally the Eighth Barcamp (BCK8), is scheduled for 28th March, 2010, Sunday at Mar Athanasios College For Advanced Studies, Tiruvalla (MACFAST).  The image is got from a google search ( Thanks to <a href="http://laughingsquid.com">http://laughingsquid.com</a> ) and I made some edits <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( not much ) .  What will make this Barcamp awesome is the speech by Shwetank Dixit . He was one of the speaker previously in the Barcamp which was held at Technopark ( I think it was BCK5 ) . If you are a web-developer who works on server side languages like PHP , Pearl , Python , .NET or any or a designer who converts PSD to XHTML or moving to HTML5 , then you will defnitely love this .  Ya there are other speakers too that I love to hear . I am not going into all who are taking those sessions , its not becuase I don't love to write here , but its already there ;) . Catch it from <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/</a> . Be part of the awesome Barcamp held at Kerala .  <del>I am also planning to take a session. But I am not sure whether I want to go with it or not as I have not mastered it . Anyway if I get some time making some slides or prepare some I will go for a session . Let's wait and see , the date is on 28th , so some more days for me to prepare .</del> You can see the updated post about the <a href="http://harikt.com/content/looking-back-barcamp-8-mar-athanasios-college-advanced-studies-macfast">BC8 here</a> :).</p>
