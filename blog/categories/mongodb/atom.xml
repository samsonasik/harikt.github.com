    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have already have read the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920001096.do">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a> by Kristina Chodorow and Michael Dirolf . It doesn't cover much on the PHP, but its a good book to learn about MongoDB and how it works in Depth. Once I saw the book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do">MongoDB and PHP</a> by Steve Francia I was planning to buy it, and the time I got a chance to signup for the blogger review program by O'Reilly Media. Its a small book of 60 pages, but a good one. I will rate 7.5 / 10 , a good read for PHP Developers . If you wondered why the 2.5 is missing read on  I have little experience playing with MongoDB and <a href="http://lithify.me">Lithium framework</a> . I loved to give an 8 / 10 for the book really . But the reason why I didn't gave is as its a small book with 61 pages, its really a good way to include installation of MongoDb in atleast one Operating System ( Ubuntu preferred ) . As its not a big pain to install MongoDb in ubuntu its really a good thing :-) . The author Steve has been working with open sky and now with 10gen, and has good experience with MongoDB and PHP . He has presented it nicely, though there are some places need some more clarifications for people new to MongoDB. Even I say its a 60 page book, you cannot just read it in a 3 Hours if you really start playing with it and understanding each and everything .  Some questions I felt in reading page 26 is "If you want to retrieve only the slice itself and not the entire document, you can come pretty close by retrieving the _id and the slice" with the example      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( 'first_name' => 'Peter', 'last_name' => 'Parker'),         array('<em>id' => 1, 'superpowers' => array('$slice' => 2)))     );  The above will give you      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )     )  The above was the only example, but I was thinking something more . What will happen when _id is set to 0 like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( 'first_name' => 'Peter', 'last_name' => 'Parker'),         array('<em>id' => 0, 'superpowers' => array('$slice' => 2)))     );  it returns      Array     (         [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )         [zip] => 10010     )  and what about _id when removed like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( 'first_name' => 'Peter', 'last_name' => 'Parker'),         array('superpowers' => array('$slice' => 2)))     );  will return      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )          [zip] => 10010     )  Somethings like this are left to user to think why its so ? Some example like 'Clark Kent' was never created, nor I remember whether he mentios to create new ones. It would have been a good idea to mention to insert new ones as the book teaches how to do it. The other one which confuses me about Indexing , ie whether I want to run the method ensureindex each and every time or only once Eg :     $db->numbers->ensureindex(array( 'num' => 1 ));  But once you finish reading the book carefully, you will definitely can use MongoDB for your next project . He covers different types of ODM for MongoDB. For further information look into the product page at http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4959237021/"><img src="%20http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/4959237021_38f1029ac5.jpg" alt="Mongo Db" /></a>  I thought of playing with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org">mongodb</a>, one among the No SQL movement. I am using Ubuntu 10.04 . Installed via <strong>synaptic</strong> , installed some GUI admin tools like <a href="http://www.phpmoadmin.com/">phpmoadmin</a> , <a href="http://www.icmfinland.fi/oss/opricot/">opricot</a> (Both these tools are not necessary , just installed those to see how it works on browser ) . Opened my favourite terminal , just typed $<strong>mongod</strong>  mongod: error while loading shared libraries: libmozjs.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  Wow got some nice errors . I was stuck with it and googled and moved through various blgs and forums . From <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user/browse_thread/thread/7e7fd7fa0313c326?tvc=2&amp;pli=1">one of the group posts</a> I recognised the ubuntu package is broken and you need to install via the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Ubuntu+and+Debian+packages">aptitude after adding the repository</a> . But I have another one which I have not tried , I feel it will work , so you can have a look into <a href="http://dracoater.blogspot.com/2010/08/mongodb-with-c-in-ubuntu.html">JuriTallinn's blog</a> before trying the below one, if you have already installed via synaptic.  So I just edited the <strong>/etc/apt/sources.list</strong> file . You can use either vi or gedit , and add the line      deb http://downloads.mongodb.org/distros/ubuntu 10.4 10gen  Save it and run  $ aptitude update  You may get some error like W: GPG error: http://downloads.mongodb.org 10.4 Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 9ECBEC467F0CEB10 . If you get something like this just run  $ apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10  And once again run  $ aptitude update   Hope everything works fine . Just run aptitude install and install stable , development or what ever version you love. I am installing a stable one .  $ aptitude install mongodb-stable  Now you can run your favorite mongodb from cmd line via  $mongo  And have fun . I also downloaded the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/mongo.installation.php">PECL driver for PHP</a> which is explained below.  You need to download the php5-dev package before you run . You can use aptitude or synaptic. After the php5-dev installation run  $ pecl install mongo  and adding the line in php.ini . You may be having 2 php.ini if you have installed cli interface also . It will be located at /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini , /etc/php5/cli/php.ini . If you are unsure where it is just use locate command.  $ locate php.ini  Add the below line in php.ini      extension=mongo.so  Restart your apache ;) . Done and have fun with Mongo .</p>
