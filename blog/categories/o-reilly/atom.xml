    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have already have read the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920001096.do">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a> by Kristina Chodorow and Michael Dirolf . It doesn't cover much on the PHP, but its a good book to learn about MongoDB and how it works in Depth. Once I saw the book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do">MongoDB and PHP</a> by Steve Francia I was planning to buy it, and the time I got a chance to signup for the blogger review program by O'Reilly Media. Its a small book of 60 pages, but a good one. I will rate 7.5 / 10 , a good read for PHP Developers . If you wondered why the 2.5 is missing read on  I have little experience playing with MongoDB and <a href="http://lithify.me">Lithium framework</a> . I loved to give an 8 / 10 for the book really . But the reason why I didn't gave is as its a small book with 61 pages, its really a good way to include installation of MongoDb in atleast one Operating System ( Ubuntu preferred ) . As its not a big pain to install MongoDb in ubuntu its really a good thing :-) . The author Steve has been working with open sky and now with 10gen, and has good experience with MongoDB and PHP . He has presented it nicely, though there are some places need some more clarifications for people new to MongoDB. Even I say its a 60 page book, you cannot just read it in a 3 Hours if you really start playing with it and understanding each and everything .  Some questions I felt in reading page 26 is "If you want to retrieve only the slice itself and not the entire document, you can come pretty close by retrieving the _id and the slice" with the example      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( 'first_name' => 'Peter', 'last_name' => 'Parker'),         array('<em>id' => 1, 'superpowers' => array('$slice' => 2)))     );  The above will give you      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )     )  The above was the only example, but I was thinking something more . What will happen when _id is set to 0 like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( 'first_name' => 'Peter', 'last_name' => 'Parker'),         array('<em>id' => 0, 'superpowers' => array('$slice' => 2)))     );  it returns      Array     (         [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )         [zip] => 10010     )  and what about _id when removed like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( 'first_name' => 'Peter', 'last_name' => 'Parker'),         array('superpowers' => array('$slice' => 2)))     );  will return      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )          [zip] => 10010     )  Somethings like this are left to user to think why its so ? Some example like 'Clark Kent' was never created, nor I remember whether he mentios to create new ones. It would have been a good idea to mention to insert new ones as the book teaches how to do it. The other one which confuses me about Indexing , ie whether I want to run the method ensureindex each and every time or only once Eg :     $db->numbers->ensureindex(array( 'num' => 1 ));  But once you finish reading the book carefully, you will definitely can use MongoDB for your next project . He covers different types of ODM for MongoDB. For further information look into the product page at http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do</p>
