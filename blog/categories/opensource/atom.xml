    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4978701845/" title="Richard Matthew Stallman by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/4978701845_6c85994243.jpg" alt="Richard Matthew Stallman" /></a>  As NIT was celebrating its Golden Jubilee this year , they was conducting a National Conference on Free Software and Education ie FOSS in Education.  I got a chance to be part of the Inaugral function held on Spetmeber 10th. Ricard Mathew Stallman was the Keynote addresse .  He talks slowly and clearly .  He says FOSS means Free and Open Source Software , I am not here to talk about opensource . I am here to talk about Free Software.  FSF and opensource are two different things .  He started talking about Free Software movement . The clutches of the developer controlling the user ( ie properitery one ) , and the other like the user controls the system .  The below lines are taken from the http://www.gnu.org/ website .  “Free software” is a matter of liberty,<strong>not price</strong>. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”. Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software:     * The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).     * The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.     * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).     * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  Example<strong>:</strong>  So are you confused with what Free Software is ?  You are going to build a house . You gave some contract to a builder named X . X build you the house and permits you to live . What will happen if he don't allow you to modify your house ? X says you don't have any right to modify it . You are unable to sell nor give it as rent . You are the person who spends the whole amount and you can't do anything with out X's permission . Is it a right thing ?  Lets come to the software world  So the philosophy is you asks a developer to build something for you and you pays him the money . He will develop all for you, and give you all the rights to use , modify , distribute so others can use it , learn etc as that of FSF policy.  He don't want to hide the code and says the code is ours. Why do he needs the code? If he is hiding the code , fear him , its the developer who is controlling you . You may not be a developer to know the power of coding :) , else you will defnitely fear .  There was a Qn and Answer session and it made everything more clear to those who thought Free Software means free as Price ( $ )  1 ) How can we make money ?  Ans : You can get some local work , and you need to work to earn money .  2 ) There is no MAT Lab . How can I switch to GNU / Linux ?  Ans : If I ( RMS ) found something that is not there in the GNU system , I ( RMS ) build it . So you need to develop one or you can find a developer and pay for it . So you can contribute to FSF .  Also why do you want to switch from GNU / Linux for not having this simple application ? There are very powerful tools in the GNU / Linux and you are loosing it for this simple application.  3 ) Some people says Windows will be effected by Virus and Switching from Windows to GNU / Linux is virus free .  Ans : We cannot gaurantee that virus will not effect your system . As far as I know there is 5 virus in GNU / Linux and may be due to the active presence of the community we are able to close the back doors .  I also met Juan Carlos whom I met at GEC thrissur for the <a href="http://ijust4u.blogspot.com/2009/01/hacker-dom.html">Hacker DOM</a> . He remembers the guys on the event . Asked about the details about <a href="http://sujithh.info/">Sujith H</a> one of the KDE hacker who hacks his Canon Camera in his free time.  The other great people in the inaugral function were  1 ) Welcome Adress : Prof K P Mohandas  2 ) Presidential Address : Dr . G R C Reddy, Director NIT Calicut  3 ) Inaugral Address : Shri Pradeep Kumar , MLA Kozikode  4 ) Felicitations    Dr A Achuthan , Institute of Engineers ( He is also celebrating his Golden Jubliee who joined the NIT, former REC )    Sri Binu A Pazhoor , CEO Kozhikode Cyber Park    Sri Nityananda Kamath , Former President, Calicut IT initiative    Sri R Sreeram Kumar , Counsellor , IEEE student branch    Sri A Rajagopalan , Chairman , Computer Society of India  5 ) Introducing Richard Stallman : Sri Sathish Babu  6 ) Keynote Address : Mr Richard Mathew Stallman ( named RMS inside FSF )  7 ) Discussion Question and Answer  8 ) Vote of Thanks : Hari C M , Student Co-ordinator .  The event started late and when Richard Stallman was given the mic it was around 7 : 00 PM . It was an awesome speech with great humour , but make people think .  He says some people suggest to learn both systems . ie GNU / Linux and Microsoft Windows . Let them learn both . He says its like giving Whisky and Water .  I was not with a camera , to take the snaps . But I and my father enjoyed the session and we left around 8:30 PM talking with Juan Carlos and all others . Lets promote FSF in Education . Let them know what FSF is , and what its for .  For more details  http://www.fsf.org/  http://www.gnu.org/  FSF distro http://www.gnewsense.org/  For other GNU distro http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2010/07/25/osi-days-asias-largest-opensource-conference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys ,  Hope you have already seen my twitter tweets about OSI Days . Its one of the largest opensource conference to be held on Chennai Trade Center from 19th to 21st of September .  <strong>Whom should attend ?</strong>  Are you a person working on opencource technologies like PHP , Drupal , Symfony , Ruby on Rails , MySQL ..... If you answered yes , then you must . We all are techies and we know or learn things from other techies and not watching a horror or comedy movie <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . We are all part of the community , so must share and learn what we have , conferences , barcamps etc are a nice place to meet guys of same taste and interests .  I loved to attend the Zendcon and many other opensource conference held previously . But my 2 to 3 months of salary was for the ticket . Travelling expenses and boarding extra . So if you are a person like me ( especially from India ) , who loves to attend the conferences , then you will never get a good opporchunity than this .  <strong>Sessions and Tutorials</strong> :  I am a fan of Fabien, after I heard about the symfony project  some years back. I read many of his blog posts and it was really awesome . He knows how to teach people . Thought of going to zendcon was to meet some people like him ( But failed ) . Now its time for me to see him and not only just meet him , he is presenting and giving tutorials on  the most explosive one , <strong>symfony2</strong> which will be released in late 2010 . Jonathan wage another awesome person of sensio who is behind the <strong>Doctrine</strong> ORM . There are many more guys from the PHP community . They are Bastian Feder, David Coallier , Jakub Vrana . A good description is given in the osidays website , so I think I don't want to cover all aspects .  As the first list publishes , <strong>Drupal</strong> stands first . There are many sessions on Drupal . If you was looking the drupal community you may already know about aegir . I played with it and is really awesome . There is sessions about aegir by Dave Hall . You may wan to concentrate on this if you are working on Drupal . Marek Sotak who made the admin theme RootCandy , Prajwala Manchikatla , Ipsita Mishra , Siva Kumar Epari , Markus Franz ( also session on PHP like hiphop , quality assurance etc ) are some others who are taking sessions on Drupal ( Theming , Module development etc is covered ).  I am also looking for the session on MySQL by Sonali Minocha who is one of the first MySQL certified DBA ( Source from osidays ).  Facebook may have made some changes or forced some of the Enterprise to think about PHP . David Recordon of Facebook is with the session Building and scaling Facebook with Open Source . So I hope that too will be awesome.  I am not a great fan of building mobile applications . So if you are looking for building mobile applications you may want to concentrate on sessions by Dibya Prakash's on Android , Reetu Raj on iphone application .  <strong>HTML5</strong> has already started , and many of the browser is already supporting it ( I remember the post by sitepoint , somethig like this "Don't wait till HTML5 is stable , as HTML6 or someother version may be started at that time " . I think it was right ) . So its another topic all webdevelopers and designers must concentrate . Jason Levitt is with the topic . So I hope that will be awesome and I love seeing some demos in the presentation . ( It was in 5th Barcamp Kerala Shwetank Dixit, an evangelist of opera makes it more memorable , so I hope the same may happen here <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />  )  <strong>What is missing ?</strong>  Not seen any sessions on <strong>Zend framework</strong> , <strong>Lithium</strong> the latest framework ( the first one to be released before any others from some of the old project leaders of Cake PHP and some other framework ) for PHP 5.3 awesome :) . <strong>Zend certification training</strong> etc as seen on the home page of osidays . May be coming in the next coming days . Not sure though , if any more speakers will be included .  I was having a wrong thought that many of the developers who are interested in Conferences are Gents than Ladies . But the list corrected me . Nice to see female voice Prajwala Manchikatla , Ipsita Mishr , Reetu Raj , Sonali Minocha .  <strong>What are you waiting for ?</strong>  Yes hope to meet you there . I am looking forward and don't want to miss this chance meeting the awesome guys from the PHP community . Hope you too will be there to learn more about the latest trends and technologies. I hope I have not missed anything , if yes please feel free to let me know .  Thanks and meet you there at Chennai . Oh still more days to go. If any of the speakers are coming to Kerala , I will try to help you . So get in touch with me <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  *offer valid still stocks last ( No worries I will be here to help you , with what ever things I can do ) .  Register your presence : http://osidays.com/</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tweet Deck was the one I used as many of them fails to connect to twitter . It was available for free download , but don't think is an opensource product. Today I was looking for some opensource microblogging client . Wow lol I have already installed it, then why I have not tried it before ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4008444565/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2464/4008444565_e3718e1969.jpg" alt="Gwibber Opensource micro blogging client" /></a>  Thought of trying Gwibber . Wow its pretty cool to see . I loved the appearance . First impression is the best impression <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Its developed in Python and suppots many of the opensocial networking sites like twitter , facebook , Jaiku, Identi.ca, Flickr, Digg, and RSS. If you are an ubuntu user then you can go and get it through synaptic package manager . The Gwibber has two tabs , one to show all the tweets appearing whom we follow and the other the replies to us . Hope you too will enjoy tweeting with Gwibber . You can get it from https://launchpad.net/gwibber .At present its not supporting Windows, don't know but may come in the future , and its not a big deal for opensource lovers .  Don't know every one faces the same problem. Sometimes gwibber fails to load the twitter feeds . I thought of looking for an alternative for gwibber . Found choqok something similar to tweet deck. Don't know how tweet deck looks now .. But it was having a similar look when I first installed . You can see from the screenshot how it looks .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4299005571/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4299005571_fc17342920.jpg" alt="twitter microblogging client for GNU/Linux" /></a>  You can reply , retweet , mark favourite , delete etc . It looks really awesome and currently supports twitter and identi.ca . May come with more support for others like facebook. <del>The missing feature I feel in choqok is auto shortening of url</del> . Gwibber comes with many short url services . <del>I dinot find an option to follow a person from itself for both like the one in tweetdeck</del>. Sorry auto shortening is there . Goto Settings->Configure choqok , url shortening tab , tick shorten urls on paste and select one auto shortening service. There is option to follow the person too. Also have noticed that when you point on the short url , the real url is shown in an alt, which is pretty good ( trust and security ). So bye for now . Enjoy tweets .</p>
