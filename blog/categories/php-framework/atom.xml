    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/" title="lithium_php_framework by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg" alt="Lithium PHP 5.3 framework who loves RAD" /></a>So I hope all of you know that on 22nd July 2010, the <a href="http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-1fvf">php.net</a> announced the end of release cycle of 5.2 series ( "This release marks the end of the active support for PHP 5.2. Following this release the <strong><em>PHP 5.2 series will receive no further active bug maintenance</em></strong>. <strong><em>Security</em></strong> fixes for PHP 5.2 <strong><em>might</em></strong> be published on a case by cases basis. All users of PHP 5.2 are encouraged to <strong>upgrade to PHP 5.3</strong>.' )  There are lots of beneficts when moving to PHP 5.3 series. 5.3 is completely rewritten core, improved speed and memory utilization. For developers you need to learn something more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" />  . We have <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php">namespaces</a> , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php">Late Static Bindings</a> ,   <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.goto.php">jump labels</a> (limited goto) , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php">Closures</a> (Lambda/Anonymous functions),  new magic methods, <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#language.oop5.overloading.methods">__callStatic</a> and <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#language.oop5.magic.invoke">__invoke</a> ,  <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc">Nowdoc</a> , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.constants.syntax.php">Constants</a> can now be declared outside a class using the <em>const</em> keyword,   <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.comparison.php#language.operators.comparison.ternary">ternary</a> operator now has a shorthand form: <em>?:</em>. , <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php">Exceptions</a> can now be nested ,  garbage collector for circular references has been added, and is enabled by default etc . You can look the <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/migration53.new-features.php">new features</a> added on php.net . So before you jump to start looking for a new 5.3 series framework  you have to know what the above are .  You can use the <a href="http://in3.php.net/migration53">migration guide</a> on php.net to move your apps from 5.2 to 5.3 series . Some of the changes are <a href="http://in3.php.net/manual/en/migration53.incompatible.php">backward incompatible</a> so will break <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Now the game starts , we have a bunch of frameworks started with PHP4 , PHP5 and now on 5.3 . Lithium is stable and many of the apps are working on top of it . Lithium has some core developers who are from Cake , Zend framework etc . And some of them were the leads of that framework. So its not brought to you by some one who don't have any knowledge in PHP or the community . So you have a reason to look right ? Also Lithium uses <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/php-standards">PSR-0 Final Proposal</a> of the PHP Standards Working Group, so you can bring your favourite piece of cake from any other frameworks like Doctrine , Symfony , Zend or any other which follows it . Try not to select a framework which doesnot follow the proposal and after all its your wish <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  About the documentation: Ya , there is lots to do in the documentation part , but you can use the li3_docs plugin to read all the doc block comments from the core . The core of the framework is almost compelely documented . You can see how it works from http://lithify.me/docs . The installation guide is here http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki/guides/installation . Its well written so I feel there is nothing I want to introduce here .  One you grabbed your copy you can download the li3_docs plugin to libraries folder and add the line Libraries::add('li3_docs'); at the end of config/bootstrap/library.php .  I hope you have already pointed your application to the webroot . If not some code below by <a href="http://www.rmauger.co.uk/">Ryan Mauger</a> commonly known as <a href="http://twitter.com/Bittarman">Bittarman</a> on the zf community will help you . I got some help from Bittarman, and which have helped a lot on my future projects . So I hope this will help you too .  So li3 is the command line tool which created models, controllers and does many of them .  Creating for project is as easy .I hope you have already installed and configured Lithium and li3 command line tool as <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/wiki/guides/installation">described</a>. Lets see how and the directory structure look .  Oh simple right ? Your project is ready . Now point it changing the above name blog with hellolithium and to webroot and not public as in the previous gist. Some times this command may not work , as we expects . So the easiest way is also making a copy of the app folder and changing the name to hellolithium or the name you love . I was having some trouble but Nate helped me to resolve the issues on #li3 on freenode . Though there are not a huge fans for li3 at present the support channel is superb . You will defnitely get some helping hands on it . Nate will also be publishing a tutorial soon , so I am also looking forward on it .  So one you have pointed to the webroot it will tell you to make the resources directory writeable. All you want to do is chmod 777 for the resources directory . Now you can change your database connections from the config/bootstrap/connections.php file. Lithium comes with support for mongodb as default. But you can also use other RDBMS like MySQL , Postgre etc or you can also use Doctrine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/thumbs_up.gif" alt="image" /> . So its your wish to use what .  Moving to command line once again how to create controllers, models etc .  $li3 create &lt;name> will be creating controllers and models .  li3 create -i is used to create on an interactive way . ie once you issued , you will be getting a set of questions  $ li3 create -i What would you like to create? (model/view/controller/test/mock)  > model model could not be created.  I have not figured out why the error occurs. I know many of them are busy on their daily work . So I am looking into it , how it works and all . So you can see some other nice command line features soon on my blog.  Note : At the moment I am not a master in Li3, nor a contributor. So there may be errors from my part, sorry  and let me know if you see it and how I can resolve it .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2010/02/01/symfony-live-2010-paris</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started learning symfony after some of my experiments with zend framework and others . So I think I want to write something about the symfony live conference which will be held on February 15 to 17th of 2010 .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4323132806/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4323132806_78a0d70d8e.jpg" alt="symfony live conference" /></a>  Be part of the symfony live 2010 as symfony 2 will be revealed . There are lots of sessions by core players of git , zend , doctrine etc . Get more information about schedule from http://www.symfony-live.com/schedule .  Symfony project is supported by sensio labs . The lead developer and owner of symfony framework . Awesome community supported project . Available in MIT licence. Lots of other stand alone components are available for php developers from symfony. YAML , Dependency injection ,Templating , Event Dispatcher, Request handler etc.  Why I started learning symfony ?  Some of you may be interested to know why I started to learn symfony . After recognising the beneficts of MVC I thought of learning an open-source MVC framework. Though I was interested to learn symfony I was forced to move with Zend . Though it is documented , some one who comes without much knowledge of MVC will be weired. It was missing a good example .  Though I developed a sample application I was not feeling much comfortable to work with zend. And at that time I came to know about the presentation by Fabien Potentier "using symfony and zend" . Many people tried to convince me about the beneficts moving with zend for zend is the PHP company . But if you are not comfortable enough then I think its not good to go with that right ? ( Especially when there is none to help you ).  I was interested to see the auto generation of codes by symfony. I am a GNU/Linux user, so I used to work on command line. Working with symfony is really awesome . If you are a command line guy then you too will defnitely love symfony. Recently I came to know about the PHP bangalore users meet up was having a framework shootout . I would have been there if I was in Bangalore. But I missed that too . If anyone missed that session there is one more chance to get trained with symfony . Yes there is a new symfony bangalore group started http://www.symfony-bangalore.org .  You can get more information from http://www.symfony-project.org/ about the symfony project.  Stand alone components are available from http://components.symfony-project.org/ .  You will be hearing about lots of interesting open-source projects like swift-mailer , doctrine , twig etc .  I may be using zend components in the future, but anyway not now ;) .</p>

    <link href="http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/12/22/node-120/"/>
    <updated>2009-12-22T21:14:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/12/22/node-120</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957465/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4205957465_0c3be9763b.jpg" alt="kohana by K T Hari, on Flickr" /></a>I have heard about Kohana before too, but have not looked into it . But today I understood the fact that Kohana is a PHP 5 MVC framework and is a fork of Codeigniter.  Kohana follows strict OOP concepts . I have to admit that Zend has great libraries for Webservices and it will defnitely improve . So what importing the Zend libraries ? Yes you can <a href="http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/libraries">import zend framework libraries in Kohana</a> . Another thing is Kohana uses swiftmailer , the PHP mail library .  You may have thought why I was attracted with in a few minutes looking Kohana right ? If so then I think you want to look into the <a href="http://www.dealtaker.com/blog/2009/11/20/kohana-php-3-0-ko3-tutorial-part-1/">tutorial of Kohana 3</a> which is under development . Zend framework may need the examples like the above ones , you may wonder at seeing some documentation where to keep this and how it works etc . I sometimes even remebered reading some books from page 80 asking us to look page 480 for more details. On page 480 it may be telling about some other chapters . Kohana is not using unit testing . So if you are a big fan of unit tests , then you may want to look other frameworks like Zend, Symfony etc .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg" alt="Lithium PHP 5 framework" /></a>That's all about Kohana . This is about the new born PHP 5.3 framework Lithium. I don't know whether you have heard about the Lithium project . It was announced after zend-con . I have heard the podcasts in php architect some long days back .  Lithium uses PHP 5.3 and is a RAD framework. The project is brought to you by cakephp guys, not just cake guys , but some others too . Lithium can be used on servers who supports PHP version 5.3 . Its in the development stage. You can see more details from <a href="http://li3.rad-dev.org/">http://li3.rad-dev.org/</a> . I remember the tweet by Nate Abele  promising Li3 will have a stable release before Solar. This promise was made after Nate says <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/6275380270">to codeigniter guys</a> "Dear #CodeIgniter People, Don't you care that it's almost 2010 and you're still running PHP4 code? Yours, - Nate" and he got a <a href="http://twitter.com/enygma/status/6275503250">reply from Chris Cornutt</a> of <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> "@nateabele it's okay...we only have two more years until the world ends. Will Lithium have a stable release before then? ;)" . So you can see another wonderful PHP 5 strict OOP based framework soon . Explore the development versions to keep in touch with it.  Update : Lithium PHP framework development is going too fast. Now the version <del>0.5</del> 0.6 has been released ie they have gone more than half way . Some of the features are missing, but you can see those missing features in the coming versions . Also I have seen some of the projects started using lithium . Some of the zend framework developers also have joined the Lithium project . Don't remember the sites I have seen . If any of you are from Lithium reading this post, add your comments . If any trouble ( goo the project leader was telling about the problem with mollom ) just mail to me .  For more details about the versions you can see <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions">http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions</a> . You can see how fast its moving .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/11/07/do-we-php-developers-need-follow-single-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know you may disagree with me . But let me come to the point why I ( according to a developer view point ) thought so . Every one seems to be convinced with the frameworks and beneficts of it .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113996969/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2485/4081943187_5207f8e395.jpg" alt="Zend framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702198/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/4082702198_0c3d4c35f1_o.png" alt="Symfony PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702058/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/4082702058_69e1f84d4a_o.png" alt="Yii framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082701908/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2539/4082701908_53bb642a72.jpg" alt="Cake PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4081942393/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/4081942393_4bceb810bc.jpg" alt="Codeigniter PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="javascript:void(0"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_506c6a9e95_o.png" alt="Lithium, light weight PHP framework" /></a>;/<em>1264915123455</em>/)  Some of the most popluar open-source frameworks are the above . I am not comparing the beneficts of each framework here . Its just in the developer perspective .  I have seen that many companies are following different styles and different frameworks for developing PHP applications . Its always nice that you do what you like and you are not forced to do the same methodology .  But we PHP Developers may need to follow a single framework rather than going behind a lots of open-source PHP frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Wait wait let me tell you why . My points may not satisfy a company , but some developers may agree with me ( I hope so ).  What's the benifict for developers and employers ?  Do you stick on with the same firm ? Your employee may not be productive as you thought ? Need to expand your firm ?  If so you always disagrees with me and I cannot convince you why .  Else part ( So I hope you are not )  What ever may be your skills , may be a Lion in the old firm ( with X framework ) , but when you are given Y framework ( in the new firm ) you will be a Rat . Am I right ? So here comes the benefict of using a single framework by all PHP Developers . You are the same Lion , and can go with the same speed , convince your skills in the short time , gain more and much more . Employers can recognise and get good quality coders easily. Rapid productivity from newly hired employee.  Previously Zend was not invloved developing a framework . But now they are with the open-source <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">zend framework</a> ( I think from 2007 onwards ) . Zend is the PHP company and as many frameworks are utilizing the components of Zend framework . We php developers may need to follow <del>zend only</del> one of these open-source frameworks ( After trying some of the open-source php frameworks I think we don't want to stick with single framework <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , but to stick with any of the popular opensource framework . You can <a href="http://harikt.com/content/benefits-open-source-frameworks-over-custom-frameworks">read the post beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom framework</a> ). Zend framework is flexible to integrate on custom frameworks . For those who love to stick on with their custom framework and wants some additional functionalities especially some of the webservices, it may be good to follow zend framework . The documentation of zend frameworks seems to be improved.  I am more attracted with <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony-project</a> for the command line features, auto generation of codes, good documentation than zend , great community. Projects like delicious, dailymotion etc are using it. Enterprise like yahoo uses it. Also we can integrate Zend components inside symfony . Fabien Potencier core developer of symfony , Matthew Weier O'Phinney lead developer of zend framework gives talks on integrating these two frameworks Symfony and Zend Framework. You can learn symfony from the symony paris 2010 on february 15 to 17. More information can be obtained from <a href="http://www.symfony-live.com/">http://www.symfony-live.com/</a>. And the good thing is Symfony 2 revealed . If you are in Paris don't miss this . I would have been there if I was richer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But one day I will be there to see your talk and live presentation.  Many new php frameworks are born, Lithium project seems the latest one . Lithium works only for PHP version greater than 5.3 and is under development . If you love to start working with 5.3 it may be good to make your hands dirty jumping to Lithium . The core developers are from the old cake php framework. They started this project from scratch, so they know what good and bad is . So I am sure that Lithium will be growing much more faster. You can <a href="http://harikt.com/node/120">read something about Lithium and Kohana here</a> .  Conclusion : Though I thought we php developers need a single framework , I changed my mind.  1 ) For loose components, follow Zend  2 ) Jumping to MVC to make your hands dirty for the first time ? Follow symfony , codeignitter , cake  3 ) PHP frameworks that supports PHP version 5.3 and up : lithium , symfony 2  4 ) Need some training ? symfony, cake , zend  5 ) Supporting only PHP version 5.x and up ? : Kohana , Zend , Symfony , Lithium  6 ) Still sticking with the dirty PHP 4 ? codeignitter, cake  There are lots of comparisons available. After trying some of these, I think its good to learn symfony if you are new to MVC and looking for a framework. If you are looking for a library you can go for zend.  Note : Every logos are of the respective owners . I don't have any copyright and my points are just what I thought in a particular moment . There may be posts telling the drawbacks and beneficts of each framework .</p>
