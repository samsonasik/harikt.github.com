    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have told you , when your disk space is less, you can host your pictures in flickr, picasa or at some other place. I used to upload pictures to picasa , but some times the pictures are not loaded . But flickr is a nice solution .  Now you can edit the pictures uploaded to flickr using picnik tool. Flickr has partnered with picnik. So its easy to edit pictures after uploading to flickr . No need to edit from your system. Just upload it and edit online. It seems to be easy . <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" />  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3381/3577983096_44172c4e74.jpg?v=0" title="features available in picnik to those who upgrade it" alt="features available in picnik" /> There are various effects in picnik . You can make a particular place in colored in the picture and the remaining as black and white with Focal B/W . Cool right ? But you need to pay some . These additional features are available only for those who upgrade it.  Some of them are Neon , Snow effect, film grain , posterize etc. You can try it for free . Need to upgrade only if you love to save the picture . So why waiting go and try it man .</p>
