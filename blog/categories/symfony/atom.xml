    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first symfony workshop was on 13th ( brought qaeet application ) and the second was conducted on 21st sunday at Techjini office Bangalore . I was one among them in the waiting list in phpmeetup, but as I attended the first meetup I got the permission to be part of the second one . I travelled around 680 Km by train ( 12 hours of journey from Ernakulam to Bangalore and vice versa ) to be part of the symfony workshop in Bangalore . I was really wondering why the guys who have RSVP ed yes didnot looked so seriously to attend it . Sjoerd De Jong also have send mails to all the users in the group about RSVP ing only if they are able to come . If the guys have RSVP ed no some others was able to be part of it. The strength was only 5 ( Elvisds called one of his friend who was interested to be part of the event ) this time ( 12 guys was unable to attend as the other 12 guys RSVP ed yes <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ).  Anyway the second workshop was also a wonderful one . Sjoerd's system broke ( lol poor windows ) and he was using my system with Ubuntu 9.10 , Netbeans 6.8 , svn and some other tools . He shows the power of symfony routing with an example , symfony admin-generator , some ajax . As I want to catch my train around 5:00 PM and some others also was leaving, Sjoerd winded up the event . But it was really an awesome one . I know my posts are becoming too late . But the thing is that I am little busy with Book reviews and all .  I have uploaded the application to github . Feel free to look into the code and learn symfony. Though I have named the application as jobeet its not the jobeet tutorial . These are some of the things that we have done on the 2nd meetup . <a href="http://github.com/harikt/jobeet">http://github.com/harikt/jobeet</a> . Sjoerd also recommends you to look Symfony 2 if you are not looking to develop a project with symfony in the short time for its really a new improved code base which will be published completely in the late 2010 . You can look into the site <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/">http://symfony-reloaded.org/</a> .  Note : A help to those who are searching or looking for Bus number from Bangalore City Railway station ( Majestic ) to J P Nagar 2nd (second ) phase, 24th Main . You can get the bus from the 11th platform and catch buses numbered 2 ( 2A , 2B etc) . The conductors will help you getting the proper place . ( This is from my past journey dated 21st Feb 2010 . Platform and bus numbers may change as time passes . So feel free to update me if any )</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may be knowing that I was at Bangalore on February 13th to be part of the symfony workshop. I was little late ( late by 10 mins ) so I didnot looked for a hotel to have my break fast . The workshop was conducted by Sjoerd De Jong at Techjini office Bangalore. We developed a qaeet application ( Though I says its we, Sjoerd was the main person who was working on that . So full credits to him ). Though the strength of the people who have RSVP was 15 , some of them didnot attended the event ( May be due to some other personal reasons , but that makes a loss for the others who wished to come #fail ) . Anyway for the 2nd meetup if you guys who have RSVP ed yes and is not able to come or have changed your mind , please make the changes in the meetup site . That will be a great help to others who love to attend the session .  We were a total of 7 guys for the workshop . 3 were from Techjini itself . One the owner itslef Amith Rana and two other employees ( Amal and Amith ) . We have a great time developing the qaeet and discussing some other nice cool applications . Techjini guys was working in symfony for a long time , so they too have helped Sjoerd when some bugs occurs . We winded the session around 5 PM .  The source code of the qaeet application is at <a href="http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet">http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet</a> . I have requested Sjoerd to add a read me file which will be a great help to quickly understand . You can also watch the <a href="http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/">http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/</a> group, some times may be having the qaeet in the future .  Updated : If you are a symfony developer you will be defnitely knowing about the release of Symfony 2 which was at Symfony Live Paris event . Now its a developer preview release ( We can see the guys are excited to see what Symfony will give you ) . Symfony 2 will be available in the late 2010 . I was watching twitter and the symfony blog and got lots of information about the Paris event just finished . Symfony 2 will be using some of the components of Zend . The slides are available and is a good resource though we missed the talk given by them . Matthew Weier O'Phinney have given a talk about how to use of Zend components in symfony project . I also loved the presentation of Dustin Whittle of Yahoo . Yahoo uses symfony as a full stack framework ( Delicious , Yahoo answers etc ) . In his slide he has shown what Rasmus think about PHP framework and the bench mark of hello world application . Yes I too agree we don't need a framework to write hello world . Hell with hello world bench mark for PHP frameworks .  I know every one have enjoyed the Symfony Live held in Paris . And lets wait to see the first release of Symfony 2 PHP framework in the late 2010 . Till then we can watch the symfony-reloaded.org.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started learning symfony after some of my experiments with zend framework and others . So I think I want to write something about the symfony live conference which will be held on February 15 to 17th of 2010 .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4323132806/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4323132806_78a0d70d8e.jpg" alt="symfony live conference" /></a>  Be part of the symfony live 2010 as symfony 2 will be revealed . There are lots of sessions by core players of git , zend , doctrine etc . Get more information about schedule from http://www.symfony-live.com/schedule .  Symfony project is supported by sensio labs . The lead developer and owner of symfony framework . Awesome community supported project . Available in MIT licence. Lots of other stand alone components are available for php developers from symfony. YAML , Dependency injection ,Templating , Event Dispatcher, Request handler etc.  Why I started learning symfony ?  Some of you may be interested to know why I started to learn symfony . After recognising the beneficts of MVC I thought of learning an open-source MVC framework. Though I was interested to learn symfony I was forced to move with Zend . Though it is documented , some one who comes without much knowledge of MVC will be weired. It was missing a good example .  Though I developed a sample application I was not feeling much comfortable to work with zend. And at that time I came to know about the presentation by Fabien Potentier "using symfony and zend" . Many people tried to convince me about the beneficts moving with zend for zend is the PHP company . But if you are not comfortable enough then I think its not good to go with that right ? ( Especially when there is none to help you ).  I was interested to see the auto generation of codes by symfony. I am a GNU/Linux user, so I used to work on command line. Working with symfony is really awesome . If you are a command line guy then you too will defnitely love symfony. Recently I came to know about the PHP bangalore users meet up was having a framework shootout . I would have been there if I was in Bangalore. But I missed that too . If anyone missed that session there is one more chance to get trained with symfony . Yes there is a new symfony bangalore group started http://www.symfony-bangalore.org .  You can get more information from http://www.symfony-project.org/ about the symfony project.  Stand alone components are available from http://components.symfony-project.org/ .  You will be hearing about lots of interesting open-source projects like swift-mailer , doctrine , twig etc .  I may be using zend components in the future, but anyway not now ;) .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/12/16/netbeans-68-comes-support-symfony-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know I don't want any one to introduce about Netbeans . When I started my mini project in Java I was using notepad, vim etc . I was not aware about the IDE's like Eclipse , Netbeans etc . Jose Antony was the person who introduced me wonderful IDE netbeans. Thanks to him .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4190704958/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2558/4190704958_c5cb8a4d2d.jpg" alt="Get Tomorrow Today with Netbeans IDE" /></a>  I started using Netbeans for developing some of my Java applications . Below is an in introductory video of Netbeans 6.8 , feel free to watch it .  When I moved to PHP Netbeans started supporting PHP too . The lastest version of Netbeans 6.8 comes with support for the symfony and zend framework ( Get more information from the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/zend_framework_support_added">blog of sun microsystems</a> ) . If you have not used an IDE , you may not know the power of an IDE . But the thing is that you will forget many of the keywords <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . For example a ctrl + space gives lots of methods and members of the particular class . So when some one ask you , you may say aah I don't remember it, I want to look into it . Thats the problem with an IDE . If you are using vim , you will never forget the methods and names, for you don't have enough time to look the class and get the necessary information .  Netbeans supports many dynamic languages like Java , PHP , Ruby , C++ etc . Netbeans is an opensource IDE and its totally free . I started using Netbeans after I got a free CD from netbeans team previously . I don't want to avoid netbeans as I love it . So get your <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/">free copy of the popular opensource IDE</a> . The caption for the Netbeans 6.8 is also interesting I loved it "Get Tomorrow Today".</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/11/07/do-we-php-developers-need-follow-single-framework</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know you may disagree with me . But let me come to the point why I ( according to a developer view point ) thought so . Every one seems to be convinced with the frameworks and beneficts of it .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113996969/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2485/4081943187_5207f8e395.jpg" alt="Zend framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702198/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/4082702198_0c3d4c35f1_o.png" alt="Symfony PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082702058/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2589/4082702058_69e1f84d4a_o.png" alt="Yii framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4082701908/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2539/4082701908_53bb642a72.jpg" alt="Cake PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4081942393/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/4081942393_4bceb810bc.jpg" alt="Codeigniter PHP framework" /></a>  <a href="javascript:void(0"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_506c6a9e95_o.png" alt="Lithium, light weight PHP framework" /></a>;/<em>1264915123455</em>/)  Some of the most popluar open-source frameworks are the above . I am not comparing the beneficts of each framework here . Its just in the developer perspective .  I have seen that many companies are following different styles and different frameworks for developing PHP applications . Its always nice that you do what you like and you are not forced to do the same methodology .  But we PHP Developers may need to follow a single framework rather than going behind a lots of open-source PHP frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Wait wait let me tell you why . My points may not satisfy a company , but some developers may agree with me ( I hope so ).  What's the benifict for developers and employers ?  Do you stick on with the same firm ? Your employee may not be productive as you thought ? Need to expand your firm ?  If so you always disagrees with me and I cannot convince you why .  Else part ( So I hope you are not )  What ever may be your skills , may be a Lion in the old firm ( with X framework ) , but when you are given Y framework ( in the new firm ) you will be a Rat . Am I right ? So here comes the benefict of using a single framework by all PHP Developers . You are the same Lion , and can go with the same speed , convince your skills in the short time , gain more and much more . Employers can recognise and get good quality coders easily. Rapid productivity from newly hired employee.  Previously Zend was not invloved developing a framework . But now they are with the open-source <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">zend framework</a> ( I think from 2007 onwards ) . Zend is the PHP company and as many frameworks are utilizing the components of Zend framework . We php developers may need to follow <del>zend only</del> one of these open-source frameworks ( After trying some of the open-source php frameworks I think we don't want to stick with single framework <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , but to stick with any of the popular opensource framework . You can <a href="http://harikt.com/content/benefits-open-source-frameworks-over-custom-frameworks">read the post beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom framework</a> ). Zend framework is flexible to integrate on custom frameworks . For those who love to stick on with their custom framework and wants some additional functionalities especially some of the webservices, it may be good to follow zend framework . The documentation of zend frameworks seems to be improved.  I am more attracted with <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony-project</a> for the command line features, auto generation of codes, good documentation than zend , great community. Projects like delicious, dailymotion etc are using it. Enterprise like yahoo uses it. Also we can integrate Zend components inside symfony . Fabien Potencier core developer of symfony , Matthew Weier O'Phinney lead developer of zend framework gives talks on integrating these two frameworks Symfony and Zend Framework. You can learn symfony from the symony paris 2010 on february 15 to 17. More information can be obtained from <a href="http://www.symfony-live.com/">http://www.symfony-live.com/</a>. And the good thing is Symfony 2 revealed . If you are in Paris don't miss this . I would have been there if I was richer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But one day I will be there to see your talk and live presentation.  Many new php frameworks are born, Lithium project seems the latest one . Lithium works only for PHP version greater than 5.3 and is under development . If you love to start working with 5.3 it may be good to make your hands dirty jumping to Lithium . The core developers are from the old cake php framework. They started this project from scratch, so they know what good and bad is . So I am sure that Lithium will be growing much more faster. You can <a href="http://harikt.com/node/120">read something about Lithium and Kohana here</a> .  Conclusion : Though I thought we php developers need a single framework , I changed my mind.  1 ) For loose components, follow Zend  2 ) Jumping to MVC to make your hands dirty for the first time ? Follow symfony , codeignitter , cake  3 ) PHP frameworks that supports PHP version 5.3 and up : lithium , symfony 2  4 ) Need some training ? symfony, cake , zend  5 ) Supporting only PHP version 5.x and up ? : Kohana , Zend , Symfony , Lithium  6 ) Still sticking with the dirty PHP 4 ? codeignitter, cake  There are lots of comparisons available. After trying some of these, I think its good to learn symfony if you are new to MVC and looking for a framework. If you are looking for a library you can go for zend.  Note : Every logos are of the respective owners . I don't have any copyright and my points are just what I thought in a particular moment . There may be posts telling the drawbacks and beneficts of each framework .</p>
