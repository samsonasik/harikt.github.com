    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was thirsty to learn a framework . It was a tough job selecting a framework too . There is a lot of frameworks for PHP . Good programming starts when you start using frameworks <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . My friend Jose Antony suggested some of them . They are  <a href="http://framework.zend.com">ZendFramework</a> : A powerful one by the PHP company Zend . Now with 1.8 there is RAD introduced . Thanks to Zend_Tool .  <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org">Symfony</a> : RAD framework by Sensiolabs . An exceptionally good documentation . Any one who is new to MVC can easily understand .  <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> : Many forum posts tell its easy to learn .  <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeignitter</a> : Many symfony users have switched to codeignitter . <a href="http://www.sajithmr.com/symfony-vs-codeigniter/">Sajith MR</a> in his blog posted also tells about why he moved from symfony to codeignitter . There may be many more guys posted about it .  <a href="http://yiiframework.com">Yii</a> : A new flexible one .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2483/3748559244_ce4acd5e72.jpg?v=0" alt="Zend Framework in Action" />Finally my choice was zend-framework and now I am loving it . As I am new to the new MVC architecture it was little bit tough for me <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" />. But recently I found a wonderful tutorial by <a href="http://akrabat.com/">Rob Allen</a> the author of the book <a href="http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/">ZendFramework in action</a> . The tutorial is an easy to learn who are new to zend-framework 1.8 .  I was not person who used to read books in my college days too . But now adays it seems I am reading a lot <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2644/3747769765_2ca82aefc3.jpg?v=0" alt="PHP in Action" />  <a href="http://www.zendframeworkinaction.com/">Zend framework in action</a> is one of the books I love to read . I hope the book zend framework in action is one of the best books to learn Zend framework . He was the advisory board member of Zend . So you can guess the remaining standard of the book .If you consider buying one , go for it . (*I don't get any money for it , never think so )  I saw another book PHP in action when I was looking more details about Zend Framework in Action . Just looked the table of contents . Yes it also a wonderful one if you are new to PHP .  Also the book is just a starting point , you need to look the mannual pages of <a href="http://php.net">php.net</a> and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/">framework.zend.com</a> to learn more .  Today I found another site which is also a good one to start . Its none other than Zend Cast . Its having lots of videos for beginners . You may love it and learn from it . <a href="http://www.zendcasts.com/">http://www.zendcasts.com/</a>  Updated on 14th October 2009 :<img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/4008823767_bf58143231.jpg" alt="Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development" />  <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a>: I got a chance to review the book "Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development" by Keith Pope . Its a wonderful book to learn Zend framework and many components . The book covers many commonly used components like Zend_ACL , Zend_Auth , Zend_Db , Zend_Form etc . Its really a nice book which will speedup your learning curve . You can also learn zend framework from the mannuals, but it may be easy to follow a person who is using zend framework than going single . The book covers a working example creating a shopping cart . It also uses good programming practices like unit testing with phpunit , debugging with xdebug etc . You can get a copy of the book from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/zend-framework-1-8-web-application-development?utm_source=harikt.com&amp;utm_medium=bookrev&amp;utm_content=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mdb_000989">packt publishers</a>. Its available in ebook and hardcopy . You will defnitely get the return once you have the book .  Hope you too will enjoy reading the book like me . I have posted my review <a href="http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development">here</a> .</p>
