    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Aptana is an opensource PHP Development IDE . I thought of learning an IDE for development . Habeeb one of my collegue have helped to learn more about Aptana . My system was a 64 bit Intel Core 2 Duo Processor .  I downloaded Aptana Studio stand alone app for Ubuntu 9.04 . I tried to run it , and got an error "/home/hari/Aptana Studio/.meta/.log" which describes the error report . I opened the .log file but could not trace it out . I searched google and found Aptana is not supporting 64 bit . First I thought it may be the problem because my OS is 64 bit . I downloaded the Aptana Stand alone for Eclipse . And I was having some more trouble configuring it .  Finally I thought of looking whether the Ubuntu 9.04 installed is 32 bit or 64 bit . I tried uname -a . You can also check the forum <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html">http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html</a>  $uname -a Linux hari-opensource 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Fri Oct 24 06:42:44 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux  Got the above output . I was able to recognise that mine is a 32 bit version installed ( If you are running a 64 bit Ubuntu you will be getting something like x86_64 in the above line ). Hm then why Aptana doesn't run ?  I looked the link once more <a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux">http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux</a> . We need to install xulrunner , although xulrunner 1.9 is installed. Add an additional file call it "add" or some thing you like and insert the below 2 lines into it .<em> *  </em>export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/xulrunne *  <em>/usr/local/aptana/AptanaStudio</em>  Make the file executable . ie chmod 777 <filename that you have named\> Eg :   $chmod 777 add  $./add  It will work fine for you . Any doubts just leave a comment. Will reply to you soon .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have updated my Ubuntu 8.10 to 9.04 in the previous month . After the update I was facing a problem when playing videos . When we plays a video the user is being logged out . It was a strange one . I looked the forum , yes many have reported the bug. As I will not be using mainly to view video I thought of not considering the issue much .  But today I was forced to fix for I want to play a movie . What to do with the bug ?  <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . As every one do I go for a google <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/whatchutalkingabout_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Yes I got the solution and its working fine .  These are the things you must do .  Edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and add the lines ( You must be root to do this . Eg: From terminal $ sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.lst ) You can use either vim or gedit or your favourite editor . I am using terminal .  deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main  $ sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xce90d8983e731f79  $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel-2.4  Just restart your system . Hope it will work for you too .  For a better understanding of the following please do look the source from where I got the information .  <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889" title="Playing video logs out">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/354889</a>  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4" title="Fix for the end session playing video in ubuntu">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReinhardTartler/X/RevertingIntelDriverTo2.4</a>  *Do at your own risk . Don't blame me if it doesn't works for you .</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yes, today I am celebrating my 24th Birthday. I am very Happy especially this year for I am celebrating with the new release of Ubuntu version 9.04 named Jaunty.These are the images from new version of Ubuntu ( After some research in the tinymce to make this pictures available in my site ) . Have a look and if you loved it, go and get it my dear friend. Its all about free and open . http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/904features/     <img src="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/904features/images/features/screens/photos/main.jpg" alt="Ubuntu 8.04 Desktop Edition screenshots" />    When I was a kid , I have not got an opportunity to give sweets to my classmates as its in the month of April. Its really sad especially when you are kids, not to wear a coloured dress to school. I think some of them have faced the same problem . But now its not a big deal as years passes.  Its really late( 04:19:16 AM ) , but thought of writing a single line on this great day.  Reached office around 6 PM . Jeena our HR wished me . I was really shocked how she knows about it, for she was new , and I thanked her . Left the room, some of them have a smiling faces, some where serious in their work. As if there has happened nothing just went near my seat. Bindu was <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> , I know she knows about it , so just said silence to her. Prasanth sir came near me wished me. I thanked him too. Martin in a loud noice asked me , "Hari is it your Birthday". He breaked my silence . After that Jinu sir, Ansar sir , Aneesh sir , Ajesh , Vijeesh and all came . Around 9:00 PM I got a card from Jinu sir, representing ISPG . This was my 2nd B'day at ISPG. I cut the cake and Ratheesh sir our great designer ( Polpularly known as Cake cutter of Panampally Nagar ) gave me the piece. It was really smelling some foul play . Yes the cream was on my face . Hm anyway I got an opporchunity too to give it to him . But failed to make a nice cream on his face <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif" title="Tongue out" alt="Tongue out" /> .  I got a lot of scraps from orkut and messages to my mobile . Some even called me and greeted. As I have changed my number some called my father and greeted him <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> . My client too wishes me. It was a great day .</p>

    <id>http://harikt.github.com/blog/2009/04/21/36-ubuntu-904-is-about-to-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" title="Get Ubuntu"><img src="http://www.ubuntu.com/files/countdown/static.png" title="Ubuntu: For Desktops, Servers, Netbooks and in the cloud" alt="Ubuntu: For Desktops, Servers, Netbooks and in the cloud" /></a>Canonical is releasing the new Ubuntu version 9.04 called Jaunty. Now you can download it for testing purpose. I still remember how I installed the Ubuntu 4.10 when I got from Akhil one of my friend who was studying at NIT. He was the person who introduces Ubuntu before me . I was using the Mandrake , rehat etc at the time . He told should be careful installing it. It was not having a good graphics at that time. But now the Ubuntu community has grown . You can see how it has made the great presence in Desktop , Laptop , Servers .  After every six months the Ubuntu will be introducing the newer versions . Do you know how the version numbering is done for ubuntu ? Its nothing but , just the year first and then the numeric digit of month . So this is 2009 April and it releases 9.04 . The earlier version was 8.10 which was released on 2008 October . So the last numbers will be always 04 and 09 . I hope there will be no change for this <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . The newer versions contains different security fixes and new software .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3322/3491661248_7d36df796e.jpg?v=0" title="Ubuntu Desktop in a glance" alt="Ubuntu Desktop in a glance" /> <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3627/3490846393_a39d5d1353.jpg?v=0" title="Ubuntu Help" alt="Ubuntu Help" /> <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3538/3491663748_08468e9dd3.jpg?v=0" title="Different Languages that Ubuntu supports" alt="Different Languages that Ubuntu supports" /> Ubuntu is a debain based GUN/Linux operating system . Its pretty simple to use . There is a wide range of choice for many softwares totally free . If your hard disk have failed , now its not a big deal. You can still use the system . No need of hard disk. Just login with your ubuntu live CD and just save in your thumb or email if you have internet connection . The internet has grown and you can explore it for your needs . Upload your favourite pictures to picasa or flicker, documents to google docs , slide share etc . It will not be this much simple with out the presence of Internet. The world wide web has played a great role in establishing these things .  What Ubuntu promises is  -   Ubuntu will always be free of charge, including enterprise     releases and security updates. -   Ubuntu comes with full commercial support from Canonical and     hundreds of companies around the world. -   Ubuntu includes the very best translations and accessibility     infrastructure that the free software community has to offer. -   Ubuntu CDs contain only free software applications; we     encourage you to use free and open source software, improve it and     pass it on.  You can get your free copy of Ubuntu from Canonical through shipping. The free disc of Ubuntu may be one of the reason for the greatest popularity of Ubuntu . I was having a dial up connection at that time. So it will be always difficult for every one to get a copy. The free disc have helped me a lot. I hope not only to me , but to many . There is a huge change for Ubuntu from the previous versions . It will detect almost all your hardwares . Its pretty simple to configure with synaptic package manager . There is inbuilt driver for the EVDO . I am using a BSNL EVDO connection. I have configured the EVDO to work in ubuntu . You can use the wvdial command for configuring it and dialling.  This is what you need to do .  Connect the device when the system boots , in the panel you can see the Broad Com driver ready . Activate it . You may need to download the wvdial using synaptic package manager . The below are the commands used to configure from terminal . ( Applications->Terminal )  $ sudo wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf  The above command will find the device and write the configuration to /etc/wvdial.conf . You can see from output whether it finds the device , if so you need to edit the wvdial.conf  $ sudo gedit /etc/wvdial.conf  I uses vim for editing . But you may not be familiar so you can use the text editor . Remove the # symbol and save your username , password etc given by BSNL authority . Something like the below  [Dialer Defaults] Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Modem Type = Analog Modem Baud = 9600 New PPPD = yes Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 ISDN = 0 Stupid Mode = 1 Phone = #777 Username = username Password = password Now you can dial using wvdial .It will hang up never close till you have finished browsing the web with your favourite browser .( Mozilla for many guys <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> ). When successfully connected you can see IP address of the form 10.0.01.12 ( some thing like this --> local IP address 10.2.40.227 --> pppd: Ч� ��� --> remote IP address 192.168.52.12 --> pppd: Ч� ��� --> primary DNS address 218.248.240.180 --> pppd: Ч� ��� --> secondary DNS address 218.248.240.181 --> pppd: Ч� ���  $ sudo wvdial  After you finished browing can use Ctrl + c to terminate .  Note : Firefox often complains about the error like below  Offline Mode Firefox is currently in offline mode and can't browse the Web. The browser is operating in its offline mode and cannot connect to the requested item. * Is the computer connected to an active network? * Place the browser in online mode and try again.  If there is trouble viewing look whether Work Offline is unticked File->Work Offline from Mozilla .  You will also have trouble connecting the empathy to chat with your friends .It will not connect even right password .Empathy will be always in offline mode even if you change to online . If empathy not changing to online mode just untick the enable networking .  You can rectify the problem by right clicking on the network and disable enable networking by unticking it .  I have recommended many friends to use Ubuntu and many from college itself had ordered and have tried it . If its releasing on 23 April , then I am really Happy bcoz I am celebrating my 24<sup>th^</sup> B'day <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" />.  The canonical is the one which supports the ubuntu project and its community . There are lots of courses they are teaching . You can help canonical and support the ubuntu by various means . Have a look at ubuntu.com for more details .</p>
