    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All of you may have heard about the google calendars . Its a free service by google. You just need a gmail id .  But I was looking like a one that's freely available. Now adays I got  a chance to work with the javascript frameworks like jquery and prototype. Working on it, I was impressed . Its really cool guys, if you know little javascript then , you can look into it . Yes once you used , you will never go without using one of it . :) .  Yes talking about the week planner . I searched for a jquery based week planner. This is one I got and it looks cute and its having almost all functionalities . I have seen a DHTML calendar , but when resizing the events overlaps. But in this there is no such over laps occuring . There are lots of methods , you can see the demo and know how it works. If you are satisfied then go and look the documentation.  A screenshot is taken to show you how it looks .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3671667577_b703d612e6.jpg?v=0" alt="A google like week planner, developed in jquery" />  The demo page is <a href="http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html">http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html</a>  You can visit the site <a href="http://www.redredred.com.au/projects/jquery-week-calendar/">http://www.redredred.com.au/projects/jquery-week-calendar/</a> , for more informations regarding it .
