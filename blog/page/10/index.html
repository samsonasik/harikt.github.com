  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957465/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/4205957465_0c3be9763b.jpg" alt="kohana by K T Hari, on Flickr" /></a>I have heard about Kohana before too, but have not looked into it . But today I understood the fact that Kohana is a PHP 5 MVC framework and is a fork of Codeigniter.  Kohana follows strict OOP concepts . I have to admit that Zend has great libraries for Webservices and it will defnitely improve . So what importing the Zend libraries ? Yes you can <a href="http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/libraries">import zend framework libraries in Kohana</a> . Another thing is Kohana uses swiftmailer , the PHP mail library .  You may have thought why I was attracted with in a few minutes looking Kohana right ? If so then I think you want to look into the <a href="http://www.dealtaker.com/blog/2009/11/20/kohana-php-3-0-ko3-tutorial-part-1/">tutorial of Kohana 3</a> which is under development . Zend framework may need the examples like the above ones , you may wonder at seeing some documentation where to keep this and how it works etc . I sometimes even remebered reading some books from page 80 asking us to look page 480 for more details. On page 480 it may be telling about some other chapters . Kohana is not using unit testing . So if you are a big fan of unit tests , then you may want to look other frameworks like Zend, Symfony etc .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4205957193/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4205957193_e0e75b521a_m.jpg" alt="Lithium PHP 5 framework" /></a>That&#8217;s all about Kohana . This is about the new born PHP 5.3 framework Lithium. I don&#8217;t know whether you have heard about the Lithium project . It was announced after zend-con . I have heard the podcasts in php architect some long days back .  Lithium uses PHP 5.3 and is a RAD framework. The project is brought to you by cakephp guys, not just cake guys , but some others too . Lithium can be used on servers who supports PHP version 5.3 . Its in the development stage. You can see more details from <a href="http://li3.rad-dev.org/">http://li3.rad-dev.org/</a> . I remember the tweet by Nate Abele  promising Li3 will have a stable release before Solar. This promise was made after Nate says <a href="http://twitter.com/nateabele/status/6275380270">to codeigniter guys</a> &#8220;Dear #CodeIgniter People, Don&#8217;t you care that it&#8217;s almost 2010 and you&#8217;re still running PHP4 code? Yours, - Nate&#8221; and he got a <a href="http://twitter.com/enygma/status/6275503250">reply from Chris Cornutt</a> of <a href="http://phpdeveloper.org">phpdeveloper.org</a> &#8220;@nateabele it&#8217;s okay&#8230;we only have two more years until the world ends. Will Lithium have a stable release before then? ;)&#8221; . So you can see another wonderful PHP 5 strict OOP based framework soon . Explore the development versions to keep in touch with it.  Update : Lithium PHP framework development is going too fast. Now the version <del>0.5</del> 0.6 has been released ie they have gone more than half way . Some of the features are missing, but you can see those missing features in the coming versions . Also I have seen some of the projects started using lithium . Some of the zend framework developers also have joined the Lithium project . Don&#8217;t remember the sites I have seen . If any of you are from Lithium reading this post, add your comments . If any trouble ( goo the project leader was telling about the problem with mollom ) just mail to me .  For more details about the versions you can see <a href="http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions">http://rad-dev.org/lithium/versions</a> . You can see how fast its moving .</p>

It<del>s scheduled for</del> was on 20th December, 2009, Sunday at Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology, Kottayam .  <del>I hope to see you guys there .</del>Hearing about barcamp for the first time ? Wiki have the answer <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  This Barcamp 7 was really really interesting . If you are a techie you missed it, thats what I can say .  Some of the sessions were  1 ) Barcamp Kerala (History and Present) by Kevin Babu 2 ) 3D Computer Graphics Programming by Praseed Pai 3 ) Building complex web site the Drupal way by Fredrik Jonsson 4 ) Media Hypocrisy and Freedom of Speech by Kenney Jacob 5 ) Giving life to discarded Computers with LTSP by VU2SWX ( by Sunil ) 6 ) Innovation! - &#8220;The UST Global Way&#8221; by Harikrishnan Nair 7 ) Multi Monitor Machines by Binny V A 8 ) Device management in modern Linux system by Unnikrishnan  This time my favorite one was presnted by Fredrik Jonsson &#8220;Building complex web site the Drupal way&#8221; . He was a person from Sweden who have came here on vaccassion. I have planned that what ever thing happens I will go to Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technlogy only because of his presntation . I love Drupal and I was interested to learn something he knows . He has already done some websites in Drupal . I got a chance to discuss with him and also Thanks for sharing his slides .If I get a picture I will keep it here .  I was little late so I didn&#8217;t cover the presentation by Kevin Babu . Sorry the private buses from Ernakulam to Kottayam was on strike .  When I reached there Praseed Pai was the person who was speaking about the 3D Computer Graphics Programming. He just takes me to my college life . The last semester programming computer graphics . Algorithms used for drawing lines , Open GL and so on . Thanks for taking me to my college CUIET again in Barcamp .  Kenny Jacob came up with the &#8220;Media Hypocrisy and Freedom of Speech&#8221; . We discussed some of the recent issues like total for you sabarinath case , love jihad issues etc .  Giving life to discarded Computers with LTSP by VU2SWX was also a great session . I think people like him are missing in the colleges. I have only some faces like him in Engineering Colleges . These type of guys are really needed in Engineering Colleges to make more professional software developers .  Innovation! - &#8220;The UST Global Way&#8221; by Harikrishnan Nair was a great one . He spoke about the Microsoft share point which the UST uses . He was poiting Microsoft guys called them and they were having a webinar with them . I have a chit chat with him , and he appreciated us for conducting these type of events .  I was hearing about the Multi Monitor Machines for the first time from my client, then from Eric of devzone and now I know Binny V A is using one . He invited us to his home to see the working demo. I am interested to visit and see a live session. So Binny you can expect me at any time <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Device management in modern Linux system by Unnikrishnan was a good one . I can see more systems coming to Barcamps are with Ubuntu . Great to see that open-source and GNU/Linux and all are changing the world .  And finally we have a talk about the entrepreneur ship and the freelancing, which was not included in the session . Some of them came with their models . One of the father came and told about his experience learning and working and building the organisation . I loved his speech and that was really awesome . He invited us for the BCK8 at his college premises . Thanks to him for the offer . Hoping to see you on BCK8 there .  Forgot to tell you that we celebrated the Christmas by cutting a cake by Fredrik Jonsson our guest for the BCK7 . Let me celebrate this Christmas with the moments from Barcamp Kerala 7 . I hope every one who was there enjoyed . During the return also I enjoyed with the barcamp guys . Thanks for the lift also Mr Dileep .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I don&#8217;t want any one to introduce about Netbeans . When I started my mini project in Java I was using notepad, vim etc . I was not aware about the IDE&#8217;s like Eclipse , Netbeans etc . Jose Antony was the person who introduced me wonderful IDE netbeans. Thanks to him .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4190704958/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2558/4190704958_c5cb8a4d2d.jpg" alt="Get Tomorrow Today with Netbeans IDE" /></a>  I started using Netbeans for developing some of my Java applications . Below is an in introductory video of Netbeans 6.8 , feel free to watch it .  When I moved to PHP Netbeans started supporting PHP too . The lastest version of Netbeans 6.8 comes with support for the symfony and zend framework ( Get more information from the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/netbeansphp/entry/zend_framework_support_added">blog of sun microsystems</a> ) . If you have not used an IDE , you may not know the power of an IDE . But the thing is that you will forget many of the keywords <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . For example a ctrl + space gives lots of methods and members of the particular class . So when some one ask you , you may say aah I don&#8217;t remember it, I want to look into it . Thats the problem with an IDE . If you are using vim , you will never forget the methods and names, for you don&#8217;t have enough time to look the class and get the necessary information .  Netbeans supports many dynamic languages like Java , PHP , Ruby , C++ etc . Netbeans is an opensource IDE and its totally free . I started using Netbeans after I got a free CD from netbeans team previously . I don&#8217;t want to avoid netbeans as I love it . So get your <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/">free copy of the popular opensource IDE</a> . The caption for the Netbeans 6.8 is also interesting I loved it &#8220;Get Tomorrow Today&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I downloaded the Google chromium OS from google . I was having some trouble configuring my Ubuntu 9.04 with virtualbox ( Not the bug of virtual box or Ubuntu , it was my fault <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ). Downloaded Karmic Kola ( Ubuntu 9.10 ) and installed from USB . You can see my <a href="http://harikt.com/gnu-linux-and-open-source/43-booting-gnewsense-gnulinux-from-usb">previous post how to create USB from image</a> . The newer versions of Ubuntu rocks . Anyone needs it , just get in touch with me .  Now I downloaded the google chromium virtual box image from techcrunch ( I thought not to reinvent the google chromium virtual box image ) . If you want to try chromium you can go and get the image from <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/guide-install-google-chrome-os/">techcrunch</a> and the post demonstrates each and every step very clearly .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602164/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2778/4140602164_a141143b1c.jpg" alt="Login screen of chromium" /></a>  Login Screen  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602332/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2514/4140602332_714550bd56.jpg" alt="Signing in to chromium OS" /></a>  Signing Hari K T to chromium OS  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4140602434/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2673/4140602434_209bd9f9ec.jpg" alt="Chromium Desktop" /></a>  Chromium Desktop  As google says everything is online . You may not be able to login to Chromium if you are not connected to Internet . I have not read the future plans of the chromium OS . But I have some suggestions .  1 ) Chromium may need a facility to go offline too .  I hope my first point is very clear . We must be able to login to chromium when there is no internet connection too .  2 ) Office , a one like open-office ( a tool similar to microsoft office, not properitery but free and opensource <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  Google is using google docs which is also an online tool . We may need a facility to use google docs even we are offline . ie saving somthing in an xml format or what ever the good format is in our hard disk and synchronising after we go online .  3 ) Todo list  I was very Happy to see the todo list . But it seems its only available for the google team . Its not for us <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But it may be good if we ( chromium users ) too get a todo list from google . Although google calendar is there .  And everything that you see in the google chromium list are online tools . So we need offline facility too . Hope google chrome OS will come with it , also  gtalk ( with voice support ) .  If I have missed any let me know .</p>

You will get the time and which movie is playing in the theatere . Seems an interesting one .  There is also one more interesting thing , if you are looking to create website in google pages new templates are available . So check it out and create your webpages for free .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have combined the basic things that are needed when you are developing a website using zend framework . Not included the zend framework library . This zfbase contains an admin module and a default module ( <a href="http://blog.nickbelhomme.com">Nick Belhomme</a> technique <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) .  It also uses the <a href="http://amazium.be/">amazium blog</a> technique ( Jeroen Keppens ) to load the different layout for admin and front page .  If you need to connect to a db just uncomment the line in the application.ini of config directory and give the necessary details . This was a technique I learned from Rob Allen author of the book &#8220;zend framework in action&#8221; , zend framework educaton advisory board member and owner of the site <a href="http://akrabat.com">akrabat</a> .  I hope these files can be just copied to start another project . You don&#8217;t want to issue the command zf create project <project name\> any more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . You can still use zf command to generate contollers and actions . Many of you may be having your own zend framework skelton . This is for those who don&#8217;t have one and who is looking to learn how module , layout etc works in zend framework .  The zfbase skelton contains an admin module where you can place admin models and controllers . Default module the same as that of quickstart , not having any difference . So this will help newbie to zend-framework . You don&#8217;t need to spend any more time googling . All you need is to get this and start your zend framework project .  There are many techniques , this is one way that you can do it . If you have some other nice way share and let others learn that technique too .  Tweet ( #zfbase , tinyurl : <a href="http://bit.ly/1y5me" title="http://bit.ly/1y5me">http://bit.ly/1y5me</a> ) this if you liked it . Don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://www.dzone.com/links/zend_framework_skelton_for_newbies_to_start_your.html">promote this link in dzone</a> . You don&#8217;t want to pay anything for writing comments , then why are you waiting ?.  Thanks to zend framework and all zend framework bloggers who are helping . I don&#8217;t have any copy-right all rights to respective owners <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .

But before the blog post about the <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">blog tutorial using zend framework</a> , it was far away <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . You cannot think the number .  But now I am happy as I am below 10 lakhs . I don&#8217;t really know how its working , because we are not placing any javascript or anything in our site for alexa to crawl. If its google then I can say its with the google webmaster tools .  I am very happy to see even though harikt.com is not in the hundreds or thousands . I wonder how much bandwidth is consumed for the sites in the top list . Even my site consumes a huge bandwidth .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116300059/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/4116300059_698808b5b1.jpg" alt="About the article in phpdeveloper.org" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116294515/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2750/4116294515_490f33347b.jpg" alt="Article in devzone" /></a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4116260005/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4116260005_00795e500a.jpg" alt="Home page of framework.zend.com" /></a>  Thanks especially to phpdeveloper.org ,  devzone.zend.com for publishing my post about developing a <a href="http://harikt.com/content/simple-blog-using-zend-framework-19">simple blog application using zend framework</a> and making such a huge hits , also to zend for keeping in the home page .</p>

The bug hunt is on Thursday and Friday, 19-20 November 2009 every one can join .  I was not previously logging to #zftalk or #zftalk.dev irc channels . But seeing the post by <a href="http://blog.astrumfutura.com/archives/423-A-Guide-To-Zend-Framework-Bug-Hunt-Days.html">Padraic</a> I was interested to look into it . I added the chatzilla addon of mozilla firefox and logged in to the irc channels .  Yes it was my first experince in an irc ( though I have been hearing about irc for a long time ) . I am not a master in Zend framework , but I would love to sign a CLA ( Contributor License Agreement ) , for the points that Padraic points out . If I have not read about the post I may not have thought of signing a CLA too .  If you are using Zend framework , then you too can help to grow the zend framework . Please do read the post by Padraic .  Thanks once again to all . ( Image credits to Google ( labeled to reuse from http://frank.itlab.us ) )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys agian I got a chance to review the book titled &#8221;<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/drupal-6-content-administration/book">Drupal 6 Content Administration</a>&#8221; by J. Ayen Green published by Packt Publisher . ( The other one was <a href="http://harikt.com/content/zend-framework-18-web-application-development">Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development</a> by Keith Pope a wonderful book to learn Zend framework ) . If you have not heard about drupal before , the best example to show you is this website . Yes harikt.com is running on drupal , the powerful content management system ( CMS ) .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4113837029/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2541/4113837029_df883e1615.jpg" alt="Drupal 6 Content Administration by Packt" /></a>  Drupal is a flexible CMS than Joomla ( with my experience ) . The flexibility come with the modules like CCK , Views , WYSIWYG editor , IMCE , poor mans cron , taxonomy etc .  Let me tell you what I felt after reading the book . This is my personal review and may be wrong , but if the below thing are added it will be an advantage .  1 ) Drupal core is just below 2Mb . Doesn&#8217;t comes with default rich text editor . But we can extend it with modules . There are a lots of powerful third party modules . The book doesn&#8217;t help you how to install the module. ( Page 85 The process of obtaining and installing modules is beyond the scope of this book, but the URL where they can befound is given in Appendix B. )  2 ) Drupal&#8217;s main feature with other CMS is , they have a dedicated team for testing . They fixes and alerts the drupal users about the issues . So the drupal site must be upgraded with the latest version whether its core or modules . If you have not done , your website can be cracked by any other person who knows how to do it . Data loss is a huge loss <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . But I didnot see a chapter dedicated for this .  3 ) If you are looking for just a blog with out much features wordpress will do it . But the power of Drupal is to run multiple websites with a single core . ie harikt.com , drupal.org can be run from a single core of drupal . You don&#8217;t need to go and install seperate drupal core . So upgrading modules and core is so simple . The book fails to point about it .  4 ) Just installing a module will not configure the many options in Drupal . Drupal has lots of features like roles and privileages . Though the book tells about some nice modules that every drupal site uses, it fails to show completely .  So I recommend packt to check the above things that will help to make the book better . I heard that the book is doing good and I happy to hear that it helps some . But looking the above things will make it much more better . I am interested to hear from people who have read this book , whether I have written anything wrong . My personal opinion is that this book may not help a newbie to administer drupal .  In the first installation I didnot loved Drupal , but have gone for Joomla . Later I was in love with Drupal . The community is powerful which makes me close to drupal . Some people may say a image is worth better than 1000 words <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> , so I personally feels videos may be good than reading a book.  I personally look <a href="http://drupal.org">drupal</a> , <a href="http://lullabot.com">lullabot</a> , <a href="http://acquia.com">acquia</a> , <a href="http://learnbythedrop.com/">learn by the drop</a> ( I learned many things from this website . A big Thanks to Robert Safuto ) and many bloggers. Acquia ( run by Dries Buytaert the person behind Drupal ) and Lullabot ( I am a fan of <a href="http://webchick.net/about">Angie Byron</a> who is the Drupal 7 core maintainer ) have some core drupal developers . There many other too . I love watching some of the previews of the of <a href="http://store.lullabot.com/">store.lullabot.com</a> . Lullabot has a collection of videos to learn and master drupal . You can see what others say . I hope you too will enjoy my collections .</p>
