  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may forget some of your passwords when its not used often . Its really a painful process for me as I am having lots of accounts . I don&#8217;t love to make the same password for every one. So forget password link always helps you . You may need to open the secondary email and configure the new password. Recently google has launched a new service . You can enter your mobile number , so the new password will be send to your mobile. So you don&#8217;t need to open some other mail and get the password .( Or if you have forget the password of that then <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  You can sign into <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/">https://www.google.com/accounts/</a> and add a phone number in the SMS tab . Screenshot of it is attached .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/3710605492_9735670a27.jpg?v=0" alt="Gmail password on your cell phone" />  Note : Please do not give your connection to some one else if you have added this option . Do confirm that the number typed is your mobile number itself .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Zimbra is an opensource desktop application software . Its for GNU/Linux and Mac OS from Yahoo . Zimbra is another Yahoo company one like the delicious book mark management <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />. I was using Mozilla Thunder bird , but when I saw Zimbra with much more features than that , I thought of trying it .  Yes its having nice features, I love the look of it. Its based on the Mozilla . Some of the features are having calendar in it . So we can organise calendars , check emails whether its Yahoo, Gmail , MSN , AOL , Zimbra, Hot mail or any  from it . You can check your flickr images from Zimbra.  There is a slight problem with Zimbra connecting to flickr . Though Zimbra is a yahoo company its having trouble getting pictures from the flickr ( run by yahoo itslef ).  The screen shot is shown here to see how it looks .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2580/3697516753_a82ee6abbe.jpg?v=0" alt="Zimbra running on Ubuntu Desktop of Hari K T" />  When we try to check the flickr pics, it asks for authentication and we can authenticate to our yahoo account . We can upload pictures from the new window , but I don&#8217;t find a scroll bar to scroll down . We can use the Tab to got to the submit buttons . I don&#8217;t know whther yahoo have tested this in Ubuntu . Also don&#8217;t know whether the issue is only for me . Another one is it creates a short cut to start Zimbra desktop . But icon is not appearing and also asks whether we need to run it . The screen shot of trying to upload pictures through Zimbra is below.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3698385622_a9965aab3d.jpg?v=0" alt="Zinbra accessing the flickr" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are the steps that are needed to make a database connection to run queries inside the aptana IDE .  Click the Database Perspective . Right click and add Database . Enter a name to recogise easy for you .  ( Picture below shows it )  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/3694154069_10f353d8c5.jpg?v=0" alt="First screen shot , how to run mysql queries inside aptana studio" />  Clicking Next will ask you for the username and password and the connection string . The user name and password is that of your mysql db . Hope you have already installed MySQL .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2669/3694154075_ab66c55792.jpg?v=0" alt="Connection string for aptana studio" />  The connection string is <strong>jdbc://mysql://localhost:3036/</strong>  when its ok you can test it and check whether it works fine .  Connecting to server is jdbc://mysql://www.domain.com:port/  I too have searched to find the solution . Got it from Aptana forum . The forum is great, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aptana is an opensource PHP Development IDE . I thought of learning an IDE for development . Habeeb one of my collegue have helped to learn more about Aptana . My system was a 64 bit Intel Core 2 Duo Processor .  I downloaded Aptana Studio stand alone app for Ubuntu 9.04 . I tried to run it , and got an error &#8220;/home/hari/Aptana Studio/.meta/.log&#8221; which describes the error report . I opened the .log file but could not trace it out . I searched google and found Aptana is not supporting 64 bit . First I thought it may be the problem because my OS is 64 bit . I downloaded the Aptana Stand alone for Eclipse . And I was having some more trouble configuring it .  Finally I thought of looking whether the Ubuntu 9.04 installed is 32 bit or 64 bit . I tried uname -a . You can also check the forum <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html">http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html</a>  $uname -a Linux hari-opensource 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Fri Oct 24 06:42:44 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux  Got the above output . I was able to recognise that mine is a 32 bit version installed ( If you are running a 64 bit Ubuntu you will be getting something like x86_64 in the above line ). Hm then why Aptana doesn&#8217;t run ?  I looked the link once more <a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux">http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux</a> . We need to install xulrunner , although xulrunner 1.9 is installed. Add an additional file call it &#8220;add&#8221; or some thing you like and insert the below 2 lines into it .<em> *  </em>export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/xulrunne *  <em>/usr/local/aptana/AptanaStudio</em>  Make the file executable . ie chmod 777 <filename that you have named\> Eg :   $chmod 777 add  $./add  It will work fine for you . Any doubts just leave a comment. Will reply to you soon .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one may have once thought of downloading any video which is played at youtube or dailymotions or any video sites. I have thought of so many times.  This is pretty simple. You don&#8217;t need a addon or go to another site for it .  For downloading videos and play locally at my system , I am using Mozilla Firefox, and I recommend each and every one to use it . Its the popular opensource browser which is faster than any . Having lots of addons . The only browser that may be supporting HTML 5  <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Sorry Opera too is supporting . Looked IE8 and Google Chrome too from my office . No it doesn&#8217;t  for now , may be in the future . It may not be helpful to users, but great for developers .  So talking about playing a video locally  right <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . First clear the cache of browser ( Tools->Clear Recent History ) . Firefox 3.5 comes with a great improved techniques . You just need to clear cache . You can clear others too if needed . Its not a big deal if you don&#8217;t clear cache too . I am clearing the cache to quickly see the file I need .  Play the youtube video or what ever video you need to play . After finished playing the video take a new tab ( Ctrl+t ) , type about:cache in the address bar . I have just kept a screenshot .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2450/3684118719_068bbeab2d.jpg?v=0" alt="cache result" />  Copy the cache directory and paste in your favourite explorer . I am using Nautilous , windows guys paste in the explorer . Now you can see lots of files. Arrange them according to file size . Go and play the videos using vlc ( Video Lan Controller ), another opensource player . One of my friend and collegue was behind this post. His name is M S Sujith .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3653/3684140583_f5369b963c.jpg?v=0" alt="Screenshot of playing mozilla firefox cache video" />  You don&#8217;t need any addon . Have it . Remember to move from cache if you need it permenantly . Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hello my dear friends ,  I was using GNU/Linux for some 3-4 years now . The one of the browser which comes with every distribution of GNU/Linux is Firefox . Its a wonderful opensource browser available for every Operating Systems . The firefox has a collection of Addons, which makes it much powerful than any other browser .  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/?from=sfx&amp;uid=267461&amp;t=322"><img src="http://images.spreadfirefox.com/affiliates/Buttons/firefox3/foxkeh-fx3-300x250.png" alt="Spread Firefox Affiliate Button" /></a>  I think I was little late to join the community spread firefox . But today I joined the community to spread the fire of the Fox . I have recommended many of my friends for using the nice browser. Once you use you will never go for any other browser . The community is powerful, this may be one of the greatest advantage of firefox . Go and try if you have not downloaded one .</p>
