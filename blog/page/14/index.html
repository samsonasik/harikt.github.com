  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know any of you know why education is needed ? Whats the value of education in life ?  According to me , education does&#8217;nt means only knowledge gained from an institution or getting a degree . Its making a person as a human . Many of you may disagree with me . I have found many people who have a PHD even fails to recognise human <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/omg_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  A best example I can show you that many of the Keralites are still not educated is many people strikes against the introduction of a chapter &#8220;മതം ഇല്ലാത ജീവന്‍ &#8221; in the 7th standard. I don&#8217;t know why every one complains about the chapter . India is a country rich with many religions , that may be the unity of India too . Look our neighbours Pakisthan , Bangladesh and all . Do you want a country like that ?  I don&#8217;t know who my Ancestor&#8217;s is . You may be knowing upto your grand father . A man is born without  a religion or caste . But when they grow they are quarelling on the basis of caste and religion . I remember the old song &#8220;മനുഷ്യന്‍ മതങ്ങളെ സൃഷ്ടിച്ചു &#8230;&#8221; , every one may love the song , but is never recognising the meaning and words .  So guys its time to wake up . Act wise , this is what education is <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />.  Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All may be hearing about the buzz word Ruby on Rails. So I thought to peep into What Ruby on Rails is . I thought of getting exited by Ruby on Rails , so watched the video <a href="http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov">http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/rails_blog_2.mov</a> . Yes I was really excited.  But can we compare Ruby on Rails with PHP ? Never you should not compare Ruby on Rails with PHP. Then Why isnt ?  Yes , PHP  and Ruby are two languages used for web-development . Rails is a MVC framework for the programming language Ruby . There are lots of frameworks for PHP like the zend framework from the supporters of PHP , yii , symfony , PHPCake , Code Ignitter and much more . You can see similar examples to get excited in PHP frameworks . So you can compare rubyonrails with zend-framework , code-ignitter , yii , symfony or any . PHP has a wide range of frameworks , does Ruby have something like this ? I don&#8217;t know . So sorry .  I have read in a blog why Ruby on Rails went to some what popular . Its mainly because, at that time PHP was not purely object oriented. I don&#8217;t remember where I read about it . Anyway one was in <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org">phpclasses.org</a> . Manuel Lemo has made it some what clear about it .  Recently I was arguing with one of my collegue that , PHP is secure, but you need to code it correctly . He told me that PHP lags security . Yes, it may lacks security when you code not propery . As the web now adays is dynamic and getting information from users, you should properly validate the inputs, else it may cause a serious damage to the site and server ( I agree , its not only the case of PHP , every web <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) .  PHP now adays have good number of frameworks which will do almost all things to make secure . But its very sad that many of the PHP developers are still using without frameworks . Frameworks increases the productivity . No one knows the working of many sites, but many of the websites are insecure .  The developers need to be careful and should know the attacks that will happen to a website when its live . But many people fails to do the necessary actions. Your design may look good , but it may lags security <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/devil_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So try to move using some nice frameworks .  So PHP  with some frameworks can be compared with rubyonrails .</p>

I am hoping that the voice and video chat will be available from 2010 for GNU/Linux systems .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may forget some of your passwords when its not used often . Its really a painful process for me as I am having lots of accounts . I don&#8217;t love to make the same password for every one. So forget password link always helps you . You may need to open the secondary email and configure the new password. Recently google has launched a new service . You can enter your mobile number , so the new password will be send to your mobile. So you don&#8217;t need to open some other mail and get the password .( Or if you have forget the password of that then <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> )  You can sign into <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/">https://www.google.com/accounts/</a> and add a phone number in the SMS tab . Screenshot of it is attached .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2639/3710605492_9735670a27.jpg?v=0" alt="Gmail password on your cell phone" />  Note : Please do not give your connection to some one else if you have added this option . Do confirm that the number typed is your mobile number itself .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Zimbra is an opensource desktop application software . Its for GNU/Linux and Mac OS from Yahoo . Zimbra is another Yahoo company one like the delicious book mark management <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" />. I was using Mozilla Thunder bird , but when I saw Zimbra with much more features than that , I thought of trying it .  Yes its having nice features, I love the look of it. Its based on the Mozilla . Some of the features are having calendar in it . So we can organise calendars , check emails whether its Yahoo, Gmail , MSN , AOL , Zimbra, Hot mail or any  from it . You can check your flickr images from Zimbra.  There is a slight problem with Zimbra connecting to flickr . Though Zimbra is a yahoo company its having trouble getting pictures from the flickr ( run by yahoo itslef ).  The screen shot is shown here to see how it looks .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2580/3697516753_a82ee6abbe.jpg?v=0" alt="Zimbra running on Ubuntu Desktop of Hari K T" />  When we try to check the flickr pics, it asks for authentication and we can authenticate to our yahoo account . We can upload pictures from the new window , but I don&#8217;t find a scroll bar to scroll down . We can use the Tab to got to the submit buttons . I don&#8217;t know whther yahoo have tested this in Ubuntu . Also don&#8217;t know whether the issue is only for me . Another one is it creates a short cut to start Zimbra desktop . But icon is not appearing and also asks whether we need to run it . The screen shot of trying to upload pictures through Zimbra is below.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3577/3698385622_a9965aab3d.jpg?v=0" alt="Zinbra accessing the flickr" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are the steps that are needed to make a database connection to run queries inside the aptana IDE .  Click the Database Perspective . Right click and add Database . Enter a name to recogise easy for you .  ( Picture below shows it )  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/3694154069_10f353d8c5.jpg?v=0" alt="First screen shot , how to run mysql queries inside aptana studio" />  Clicking Next will ask you for the username and password and the connection string . The user name and password is that of your mysql db . Hope you have already installed MySQL .  <img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2669/3694154075_ab66c55792.jpg?v=0" alt="Connection string for aptana studio" />  The connection string is <strong>jdbc://mysql://localhost:3036/</strong>  when its ok you can test it and check whether it works fine .  Connecting to server is jdbc://mysql://www.domain.com:port/  I too have searched to find the solution . Got it from Aptana forum . The forum is great, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aptana is an opensource PHP Development IDE . I thought of learning an IDE for development . Habeeb one of my collegue have helped to learn more about Aptana . My system was a 64 bit Intel Core 2 Duo Processor .  I downloaded Aptana Studio stand alone app for Ubuntu 9.04 . I tried to run it , and got an error &#8220;/home/hari/Aptana Studio/.meta/.log&#8221; which describes the error report . I opened the .log file but could not trace it out . I searched google and found Aptana is not supporting 64 bit . First I thought it may be the problem because my OS is 64 bit . I downloaded the Aptana Stand alone for Eclipse . And I was having some more trouble configuring it .  Finally I thought of looking whether the Ubuntu 9.04 installed is 32 bit or 64 bit . I tried uname -a . You can also check the forum <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html">http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-921081.html</a>  $uname -a Linux hari-opensource 2.6.27-7-generic #1 SMP Fri Oct 24 06:42:44 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux  Got the above output . I was able to recognise that mine is a 32 bit version installed ( If you are running a 64 bit Ubuntu you will be getting something like x86_64 in the above line ). Hm then why Aptana doesn&#8217;t run ?  I looked the link once more <a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux">http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Installing_Aptana_on_Linux</a> . We need to install xulrunner , although xulrunner 1.9 is installed. Add an additional file call it &#8220;add&#8221; or some thing you like and insert the below 2 lines into it .<em> *  </em>export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/usr/lib/xulrunne *  <em>/usr/local/aptana/AptanaStudio</em>  Make the file executable . ie chmod 777 <filename that you have named\> Eg :   $chmod 777 add  $./add  It will work fine for you . Any doubts just leave a comment. Will reply to you soon .</p>
