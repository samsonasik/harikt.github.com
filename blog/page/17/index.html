  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, when you are new to webhosting, then I am sure you may fall in trouble . You may be looking for cheap hosting , which may not be reliable. If your site doesn&#8217;t get much traffic , then it may not be a big deal . But when your site is getting some what hits , then you may need to call each and every time your hosting service provider.  Some of the things must be taken in to consideration when you are moving for web hosting . Never go for the cheapest hosting. That doesn&#8217;t means when the cost is high they give good support <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . The cheapest hosting is provided to you by means of VPS .A VPS is really for small developers , but some times hosting companies make use of this . The load will be balanced to every VPS , even though one of the VPS guys ask for increase in memory or any .  Ask your friends who are some what familiar with web hosting or servers. My friend Prajith was very helpful to find me a good solution. Though there were some troubles occured , they resolved the problem quickly. The support is the one that you need. When they don&#8217;t turn up to answer you , it will be some what horrible .  <strong>Fake content :</strong> This is the one thing that you must consider , when you are looking for hosting or finding some business outside your country . I can write what ever things like, I was born on 1970 or I have started this site from 2000 onwards or something. But some of the things can be looked if you know . For eg : When some firms says we are here from 1995 onwards , then the best way to know is just a whois look up. I used to look for whois to get some information . Alexa is another solution that you can try . You can try and know the fake guys . So this is one of the important thing that you must take into consideration . I have seen some fake contents like this . But I know how to know , but sometimes you may fall in trouble if you don&#8217;t know.  You can look for the forum if , you don&#8217;t know a friend who is familiar.  I can also help you to find a good solution as my site is proudly hosted at <a href="http://rackloop.com/">http://rackloop.com/</a> . Although they are new , they have great knowledge working with servers. These guys are great and you will love their support . You can see how fast my site is loaded , even though its Joomla and some seo friendly htaccess tricks are used.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, this may be a controversial post. As I told you before , I was interested in Joomla. But its some what hard to learn , configure some of the plugins, and its not an easy task to find a good plugin. I was trying to learn Drupal , after I came to read and discuss with some of the guys who uses Drupal. Yes, I am switching my site to Drupal . So in a few days you may see a new face for this site. I am trying to configure it in my local system first, so I can learn . After that I will switch this to Drupal.  The reasons behind the switching are its easy to make a blog and add comments feature in drupal . In Joomla its tough , you may need to add additional plugins or extensions .  Recently saw a post about news paper site , which makes me interested to look how to make in Joomla, but was very tough. I googled a lot to get a right solution how it works and all . I was reading a lot of blog posts about the news paper site and finally thought to switch to drupal <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  Also have seen creating multiple sites with Drupal is easy than that of Joomla. Configuring a module and all in Joomla is tough . Once you have started working with Joomla you will recognise , what I am telling. May be I don&#8217;t have learned every corners.  Some of the reasons I thought of working on local are  1 ) My pages are indexed in google , so don&#8217;t want to make a problem .  2 ) I am getting good amount of visitors now adays .  3 ) I will learn drupal from my local :-) . Why I need to do in the server itslef ? This may be a good decesion I think .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was looking the Joomla extensions , just for fun . I prefer the GPL version to use. If the licence is only GPL I will look into it. Else even its popular one , I just skip those. Now a days I have been seeing a lots of extensions and some in the terms of GPL. When we try to download it , to know how it works , it goes to the owners site and it will be asking for a payment. Yes, I agree we can pay and get GPL versioned softwares. But what about the period ? I wondered , I can&#8217;t use it on any other server . It fucks man . Really its fucking to see it. This is what GPL is telling <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html</a>. I don&#8217;t know whether they are wrong or I am wrong. I think if there is the four freedoms in GPL then they may be miss using the GPL term. I would like to point this to tell the person who manages the Joomla extensions.He can change the things. I hope so .  As I told you , I mailed to open source matters. Got reply from Elin Waring, President , Open Source Matters.  For the first post he thought I was telling not to sell the product when in GPL . But I know the GPL , its not about money the freedom is telling . Its for the source code . It supports the main 4 freedoms. ie where GPL stands. So I replied to him giving the link to the plans. Yes he too was confused with it. Anyway he replies me . Thanks Elin Waring, I am glad to see your reply . And I am posting it here.  They are confusing about this, but the domain licenses are actually just for support. Nothing stops you from installing on as many sites as you want.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I was little late to write my post about the beautiful event held at Technopark on May 3rd. I reached Trivandrum around 5:30 in the morning after attending the reunion ( Chinmaya vidyalaya 2000-01 Batch of 10th std ) , I was not able to stay some more time with my old friends <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Around 7:30 AM , I slowly bored a bus to technopark , reached there around 9:00 AM. I was enjoying the beauty of technopark . It was an awesome place. Once you enter there , you may never love to leave. It was not only my opinion , but also some of the guys who were at Infopark too <img src="http://www.harikt.com/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( NITIN KOSHY MAM.) .  The event was at Park center. I met some of the guys like kenny , Anand and all walking towards the park center. We introduced ourself, entered the hall. Yes Binny has reached early , than us. We shared some of the thoughts . It was my pleasure to meet such wonderful guys from Technopark . There were more than 200 attendees registered and 19 sessions. But some of them failed to come and sessions shortens to 13 ( Its tough to complete 13 sessions in a day ). The event started with an introduction about the TBI, by Kenny. Some of them shared their doubts about TBI.  Some of the nice speeches I enjoyed was  <strong>Young Kerala by Rajesh Venugopal :</strong> He was trying to encwourage the young minds of kerala, and was trying to motivate each and every young persons. You can see the his blog http://youngkerala.org/ for more details.  <strong>Quick and Dirty .NET compiler by Praseed Pai</strong>: Yes, he is a wonderful guy , strong in compillers. Compiller Design was an elective for 6th semester. I have taken Distributed Systems. So some of the things he introduced was really new to me. He refeshed the Systems Programming which I have learned in the fourth semester. It was also a wonderful one.  <strong>What they don&#8217;t teach you in college by Binny VA :</strong> The next talk was by Binny V A , the PHP freelancer from Cochin. It was a real fact , what Binny introduced. When I was learning my Engineering , I was not much aware of the sub-versions. I don&#8217;t know how many of the Engineering graduates , who are in the field of computer&#8217;s know about subversions. He gave a brief introduction . I think its time to introduce some real stuffs like this , to the Engineering degree .  <strong>Peep Into PI by Vishu Gopal</strong>: This was another wonderful session by Vishnu, who was working for Mob ME .You can see the stuff http://www.peepapp.com/ He demonstrated the app.  <strong>How to Build a Popular Website in 6 Months</strong>:It was Mani Karthik , an SEO , introduced the developing a site from scratch and some of the SEO tips . I hope it may have helped guys who don&#8217;t have a blog till then a lot.  <strong>What&#8217;s new in HTML5 By Shwetank Dixit</strong> : Yes, this was one of the most interesting one , that I have enjoyed . He was very cool talking about HTML5. Shwetank Dixit was an evangalist for Opera. He was wearing a T-Shirt &#8220;War of Browsers&#8221;. He was also having some nice T-Shirt for the reply to his questions. Some of them got . I hope every one have enjoyed that a lot. The picture of him is posted below. Photo credits to Barcamp blog . Don&#8217;t know who have taken this picture.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3645/3507202917_2ae16b9e39.jpg?v=0" title="Shwetank Dixit Evangelist of Opera, the real person who rocks" alt="Shwetank Dixit Evangelist of Opera, the real person who rocks" /> <strong>Adobe Flash By Juwal Bose</strong> : Though he was not an evangelist nor working at Adobe , he was using Flash to develop games, so introduced some of them to us.  <strong>iframe Issue introduced by Kerala farmer</strong> : Most popularly know as Kerala farmer , who introuced a problem with his blog. He was having a doubt regarding the iframe , and whether any one can make datas available from other site. His question made me think a lot. It was some thing that no one was able to answer . He was adviced to get some help from Lawayers. Anyway he made me think about the legal issues. Though we all are software engineers and may know about or may have heard about the digital rights . I have not read it , once . So I was really thinking about the matter . I am having a suggestion to introduce atleat some of the laws to the Software Engineers in BTech syllabus. Else it , may make a serious problem in the coming years. It&#8217;s damn sure. So the governement should make some changes to make sure, every one goes in the right path and is aware about the IT acts.  It was late for me to leave to Ernakulam , as I am having office on Monday , I left Park Center. At present I don&#8217;t have its pics with me. I have asked Anand to share some. I hope will get it soon .     <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3619/3508042272_df7047fe5b.jpg?v=0" title="Seriously hearing and working" alt="Seriously hearing and working" />   <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3507278811_dd639c0b20.jpg?v=0" title="Enjoying Barcamp" alt="Enjoying Barcamp" />    <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3327/3508067434_ee07f1e195.jpg?v=0" title="T-BIC" alt="T-BIC" />    Thanks guys , if you are interested after reading this , we can see next time .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Writing my post from Trivandrum Railway station. Was busy leaving to attend the Bar Camp Kerala event at Technopark , so was not able to write any. It was really a Happy moment when you see your old friends . We the CUIET once conducted the reunion of the 2003-2007 IT Batch of CUIET. There was only a few attended. I have never thought the reunion of the 10th standard will be such a colourful one.  Every one was having a smiling face, even in their bitter moments . The teachers were all happy to see the old students after 8 long years. Jayadevan may be one of the happiest man , as he was really thrilled to see all of us. He was at Calcutta and reached only for this get together. The event may not occur if Rajeesh Chandran have not initiated. He has done a wonderful work. So many guys came from Chennai , Bangalore , Ernakulam and also from different parts. Some of them were working and some are still studying.     <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3565/3495904062_8fc667ed42.jpg?v=0" title="Chinmaya Vidyalaya 2000-01 Batch reunion conducted on May 2nd" alt="Chinmaya Vidyalaya 2000-01 Batch reunion conducted on May 2nd" /> You can see the smile on the faces of all. It was really a rocking day. Does any one see, any thirst for food ? Yes , we have not taken our lunch too till 2:30 PM. But smiling faces all around . Have a great day guys. Lets rock on some other day once again .  </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I still remember my old pages, got html templates for free . Downloaded and added the contents and the design was broken usually. I was not much aware of why the design breaks . My experiences teaches me a lot why its happening. I have only 1 year 5 months experience, but I when looking back I may be having more than that because of my self learning <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-laughing.gif" title="Laughing" alt="Laughing" /> . I think in one of my post I have expressed my Thanks to Dileep often called Dilpu , a student from NIT . He is one of the person, who makes me think and learn HTML . I used my class hours at Library to learn HTML . I was not aware of HTML , CSS or W3C or any standards of Web . So when adding contents to pages , I often fails at those times . It was just static pages . But later I learned why its happening , what W3C is what XHTML and all.  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3563/3490763401_8c2b1abfc2.jpg?v=0" title="Firebug mozilla firefox addon in action" alt="Firebug mozilla firefox addon in action" />  These were only to static HTML. When I started my profession I was eager to learn more and found Firebug a mozilla firefox add-on once . Installed it just to try , as its all free and open source projects . Firebug may be one of the easy tool that can be used to fix the design issues. When the designers convert to XHTML , some of them uses fixed width . But in dynamic pages , the height often changes and it may be a mess to fid out whats the problem .So here comes the role of firebug . You can view the properties for each of the tag . So you can recognise which all are inherited and all . So its easy to fix issues arising to font&#8217;s and all . I think Firebug was introduced when I was looking the carrers in Mozilla <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . They are looking people who are familiar in firebug, that forced me to install firebug . Now I know why they are looking for people who uses firebug . Great guys .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are various distribution of GNU/Linux available now. I think every disto have a Live CD . So people can try it out and if they love it , can install it . So what I am talking is, it may not be possible to create a Live CD to try each and every distro and their newer versions . If you are a person like me , then you may love to use an alternative to boot from CD, something like a USB flash drive ( popularly called pen drive , thumb )  for its reusable .  Some days before I found the new GNU/ Linux which is entirely free removing all the restricted packages which is supported by the FSF ( Free software foundation) . Gnewsense is an Ubuntu based free software distribution without non-free binary blobs in the kernel. You may think whether Ubuntu is a free one , then why gnewsense . If you have any such doubts you can have a look in the <a href="http://www.gnewsense.org/index.php?n=FAQ.FAQ" title="FAQ of the gnewsense">FAQ of the gnewsense .</a>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3491574392/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/3491574392_a807a17c45.jpg?v=0" title="gnewsense desktop" alt="gnewsense desktop" /></a>    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3491575834/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/3491575834_a0206ca88e.jpg?v=0" title="gnewsense desktop with applications" alt="gnewsense desktop with applications" /></a>       Though I uses Ubuntu , I want to try it out, so thought of downloading the iso and use from USB pen drive . There was a documentation in the gnewsense about <a href="http://wiki.gnewsense.org/Documentation/BootingFromUSB">booting gnewsense gnu/linux from usb</a> . I worked as they have written . Though I am not powerful in those commands I thought of learning the new commands . Fallen to trouble partitioning USB and all . And finally recovered every thing and restarted after finishing all the steps.  When it started I changed to boot from USB flash drive . But got a black screen with just a message error . What to do now . Changed to other usb ports , the same ( error booting gnewsense ) . hm&#8230;&#8230;.. Anyway I want to try it, booted to Ubuntu connected net and searched , I don&#8217;t find an answer for it . Anyway got another software Free USB installer ( Either youu can try http://aligunduz.org/FUSBi/ or usb-creator . usb-creator is a good choice for the aligunduz . Download the usb-creator using synaptic and issue the command usb-creator in terminal . A graphical view will appear . <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick">Read more from ubuntu help</a> ) from iso package. Free USB installer can install iso image to usb flash drive . Yes downloaded it, and tried it. Restarted again , now it works . Now its pretty simple booting gnu/linux from usb flash drive . Yes , I would like to express my Thanks to Mr Ali for his wonderful work . Yes it may have saved many people. I guess if users are not powerful in command line too or don&#8217;t know the basics or some times to people who may have failed like me <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . Anyway failure is not the end, its the begining <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/3491572538/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3582/3491572538_a6cc8b2d3c.jpg?v=0" title="gnewsense iso to usb with fusbi installer" alt="gnewsense iso to usb with fusb installer" /></a> I have taken a screen shot of the gnewsense and also the free usb installer. You can see how it looks . What I feel after working with it is, there is not much difference in menu and all, but a good color for the selection . Improved graphics . You too can try it from usb . Cheers guys , Have a great day .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one may have heard about the Google maps , Yahoo maps and have used atleast once or may have seen once . Now a days every web page too is using the maps to show their location and all . You will be getting a google maps api key in-order to show in your web page. I have used to show the IP location of the user&#8217;s in my previous site . Found another open source maps called the open street maps promoted by the GNU .     <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3664/3490762953_defeb72c4c.jpg?v=0" title="Screen shot of open street map " alt="Screen shot of open street map " />    The places are not marked completely , but in the future , it defnitely will be one of the best maps as its open source . You can have a look into the site http://www.openstreetmap.org/ and also you can edit the places , which you are familiar, so it will help others . I don&#8217;t know from which server it&#8217;s getting the data&#8217;s. But the Yahoo logo seems to be on the right side when editing .  I want to investigate into the matter , and will add more details . Thanks for reading .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know how many of you have heard about the news that the Sun Microsystem has been aquired by Oracle . Oracle is one of the worlds largest software company especially in the data base. Every open source lovers eye will be looking forward to see what will happen to MySQL which was part of Sun Microsystems now . The blog of the Michael Widenius Monty http://monty-says.blogspot.com/ , the creator of MySQL has quit the Sun Microsystem . He is hiring some of the MySQL developers who have supported him . He will continue to work for the open source database storage engine , the name is Maria . The web page of the new one is <a href="http://askmonty.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" title="Michael Monty Widenius the creator of MySQL">http://askmonty.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a> .  As every one thinks I don&#8217;t know what will be the future of MySQL. Sometimes the big giant Oracle may not support MySQL . IBM was interested in MySQL. Some times Oracle may sell MySQL to IBM, or may kill MySQL slowly . We the PHP Developers were interested to work on LAMP , the Linux, Apache , MySQL and PHP . But now I think the MySQL may sometimes will be dropped and will be changing shortly to Maria , so the new LAMP consists of Linux, Apache , Maria the new database and PHP .  Anyway lets wait and see , what will happen to MySQL .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my previous post I have expressed my concern over google and its products . Google always supporting the wonderful open source projects fails to develop its products in GNU/Linux operating systems. For example the latest Chrome is only available for windows, also gtalk .  I was hearing about skype for the first time when I joined ISPG on 27th of November 2007 . But I was able to recognise that skype is a proprietary software .So today I got some time to look into the open source softwares which can replace skype, which will increase security . As the source code of the propritery softwares are not open we are not sure how its working . Only the developer knows about the working . Our chat and files that are passed may or may not be secure . So we need open source softwares and want to promote such softwares .  These are some of the list that supports VoIP .  -   Ekiga ( Replacement for Skype ) -   Twinkle ( Replacement for Skype ) -   Coccinella -   QuteCom previously called WengoPhone -   SIP Communicator  are some of them .  <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3542/3490841365_a4a53c1a49.jpg?v=0" title="Ekiga on action" alt="Ekiga on action" />Ekiga will be installed in Ubuntu by default in 9.04 . I don&#8217;t remember for the older versions, its installed or not . Ekiga is a real replacement for skype . You need an ekiga account as like the skype itself . Then you can call from your desktop to desktop or to other land lines if you have credit . The call rates and all are in the https://www.diamondcard.us/exec/voip-rep-acc-type?secRel=/secondary/e/ekiga&amp;priRel=/templates&amp;secId=ekiga&amp;lc= . You can copy and paste it in your url if you love to know about it . The scrren shot of the ekiga is downloaded from the site . You can look into the site http://www.ekiga.org/index.php?rub=2 for the features list.  I was looking the gnu.org and reading about the high priority projects . The one among them was the replacement for skype . From there I got the list of wonderful projects . When I looked more about them , its amazing and it has even more than skype offers .  I was using empathy as there was no <strong>gtalk</strong> for linux . Gtalk is available for Windows XP . As I don&#8217;t need gtalk for Vista and all , I don&#8217;t even know whether there is any too <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> . I downloaded the <strong>coccinella</strong> project and try it, which is something like the gtalk or <strong>empathy</strong> . We can send files , supports VoIP etc as in gtalk itself . The screenshot of it is taken when I am using from my lap . You can see a detailed list of features from http://thecoccinella.org/about . As I don&#8217;t want to make a copy from ther itself <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" alt="Cool" /> .     <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Z_YIrg5qE3M/SfQP8gMBE5I/AAAAAAAAAyI/Ojfuh3wkQpQ/s512/Coccinella.png" title="Coccinella working at Desktop of Hari K T" alt="Coccinella working at Desktop of Hari K T" /> Another one is<strong>sip communicator</strong>, which is a wonderful open source project developed in Java , which supports the most instant messaging and telephony protocols . They supports SIP, Jabber, AIM/ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger, Bonjour, IRC, RSS and more coming soon . It was pidgin which supports at earlier , but now many more open source projects are available under the GNU/GPL licence . The coccinella and sip communicator has its own features. The coccinella has a support to draw pictures and show the other user with out chatting . Its a great feature I think . So each and every software has its own roles .  I am running out of time, so I am mising a lot to write . So giving the links below . So you can have a look , if you love to use open source and these projects and decide to choose which one suits best for you .  Ekiga Features : http://www.ekiga.org/index.php?rub=2  Twinkle Features : http://www.xs4all.nl/\~mfnboer/twinkle/index.html  Coccinella Features : http://thecoccinella.org/about  QuteCom : http://www.qutecom.org/  SIP Communicator : http://www.sip-communicator.org</p>
