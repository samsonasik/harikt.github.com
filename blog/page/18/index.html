  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one may have fallen in this trouble , when your disk space exceeds . Yes , I was trying to create a folder and upload some images . I noticed a fact , there is no space remaining to upload one . Yes , every one , who have a web hosting space may have thought an alternative way to store images and files . Yes, don&#8217;t worry I just uploaded to my picasa web albums <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> .  But there is also another alternative if you have a database . Yes , you can store images and files in MySQL . To store images and files use the BLOB format . It can store binary data . What you need to do is  Create a table Image , with pkid of type int(10) as unique id , data of type BLOB , format ( jpeg , png &#8230; ) and description.  Read the binary contents from the image . using file_get_contents() or fread() functions of php .  Insert to database . Now you can retrieve the image using the id . Pass the id to a page which outputs the header of image . Yes, its pretty simple to do this . The below code is a sample . You can try it out . I have not tested , just made for the post now .  &lt;?php /* Create a table something like this CREATE TABLE `Labs`.`Images` ( `pkid` INT( 10 ) NOT NULL , `Content` BLOB NOT NULL , `Description` VARCHAR( 300 ) NOT NULL , `Type` VARCHAR( 5 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( `pkid` ) ) ENGINE = MYISAM */ //insertImage.php $mysqli = new mysqli(&#8220;localhost&#8221;, &#8220;my_user&#8221;, &#8220;my_password&#8221;, &#8220;database&#8221;); /* check connection */ if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { printf(&#8220;Connect failed: %s\n&#8221;, mysqli_connect_error()); exit(); } //Read file contents $fp = fopen(&#8220;image.jpg&#8221;,&#8221;rb&#8221;); $contents = fread( $fp , filesize(&#8220;image.jpg&#8221;) ); fclose( $fp ); if ($result = $mysqli->query(&#8220;INSERT INTO Images(&#8216;pkid&#8217;,&#8217;Content&#8217;,&#8217;Description&#8217;) VALUES(&#8216;NULL&#8217;,&#8217;&#8221;.$contents.&#8221;&#8217;,&#8217;test me&#8217;)&#8221;)) { echo &#8220;Successful insert&#8221;; } $mysqli->close(); ?> &lt;?php //getImage.php $mysqli = new mysqli(&#8220;localhost&#8221;, &#8220;my_user&#8221;, &#8220;my_password&#8221;, &#8220;database&#8221;); /* check connection */ if (mysqli_connect_errno()) { printf(&#8220;Connect failed: %s\n&#8221;, mysqli_connect_error()); exit(); } //Read image contents if ($result = $mysqli->query(&#8220;SELECT Content FROM Images WHERE pkid = &#8216;&#8221;.$_GET[&#8216;pkid&#8217;].&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;)) { $row = $result->fetch_assoc(); } header(&#8216;Content-Type: image/jpeg&#8217;); echo $row[&#8216;Content&#8217;]; ?>  <img src="getImage.php?pkid=<?php echo $pkid ?\>&#8221; alt=&#8221;&lt;?php echo $description ?>&#8221; title=&#8221;&lt;?php echo $description ?>&#8221; />  This is just a sample. I hope you know some basics of PHP . You can modify the script as needed, and also do care about SQL injections <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-tongue-out.gif" title="Tongue out" alt="Tongue out" /> . You can encrypt the values that are passed for additional security measures . Have not tested this , just made this in a hurry . So may contains errors. Please do report if you find some . I will be happy to hear it from you .  You can use the sameway to store the word , pdf etc in the MySQL . Its simple to make it work . You can change the content type of header , so as to make it dynamic .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was sleeping when Faizal , called me and told about the Calicut University declared the fourth and sixth semester results . There was little hope for me , I know university you loves me, that&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t leave me . Yes, got only 1 paper Hardware Systems design ( Thanks at-least I got one <img src="plugins/editors/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" alt="Smile" /> ) . Still waiting for the revaluation results of the previous exam ( December 2008 ) . I may some times get a pass mark . Anyway lets wait and see.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Writing my post from Open solaris . This is a great experience , so thought to share with you , so may help some of you.  I have once installed the Sun Solaris , not the Open Solaris of sun . And it was really a tedious job . So I was aware of the consequences . But thought of trying the Open Solaris , as I love to use it after trying the Live CD. Though I have got the CD some days before , not able to try it.  Current OS and status  1 ) Installed Ubuntu 8.10 , having lots of additional softwares installed and lots of valuable data&#8217;s :-) .  2 ) Don&#8217;t want to miss any , like the previous case.  Started Installation around 12:30 noon . It takes some time to install the OS. I came after my Lunch and by the time it has finished the installation .  Restarted the system. The grub loads &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; OOP&#8217;s really fucking , the Ubuntu is not there , it has gone . The boot loader has gone . Anyway thought of reinstalling the grub . I have installed from Fedora the boot loader , but not from Ubuntu , so thought of editing the grub file for the sun solaris. But I need to know the real path to the Ubuntu kernel . Booted from Ubuntu Live CD , searched google to find from where I will get the complete path ? Yes, found a solution for it , ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/ ). Downloaded and tried , got the result. Saved in gmail :-) . Restarted the system , logged to Open solairs .  Looked to edit grub . Searched a lot , got some information from blog of sun. He is a worker at Sun . ( http://blogs.sun.com/agraj/entry/editing_grub_bootloader ) . But I was not able to find the /etc/grub.conf nor the /boot/grub/menu.lst ( Skipping some of the steps I have tried to edit grub from command prompt ) . And finally I was forced to login to Live CD , and tried to do like the steps in http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-24113.html the post . But what I missed was Open Solaris loader and time and the updated kernel of Ubuntu . What it does was installed the Ubuntu OS again .So never go in these ways , I will shortly tell the other one. Why I told never go in this way is because it will remove some of the files of our updated kernel , though it can backup our files. And finally I edited the /boot/grub/menu.lst of the Ubuntu distro and added the code  title Open Solaris root (hd0,0) makeactive chainloader +1  <strong>The pretty simple way</strong> ( I was not able to try this , but found the menu.lst of Open Solaris ) :  1 ) Install Solaris  2 ) Boot with Live CD , install the boot info script and run it ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/bootinfoscript/ ) . Save the RESULTS.txt may be in you mail or thumb .  3 ) Restart to login to Open Solaris . Edit the menu.lst , ( its not located at /etc/grub.conf nor at /boot/grub/ ) . The menu.lst has moved to /rpool/boot/grub/ folder . So what you need to do is just edit the /rpool/boot/grub/menu.lst . You must be root to edit this file ( Use su or sudo ).  Copy and paste the lines you have got from the RESULTS.txt which is produced by the boot info script . Some thing starting like ## ## End Default Options ## and ending with ### END DEBIAN AUTOMAGIC KERNELS LIST . You can have a search if you are using gedit .  Now restart your system . It will works . Defnitely it will work . Have fun with solaris too . Spend my whole day for this experiment :-( . But learned a lot of new things , so I gained :-)  Thanks guys , let me have some sleep its 1:05 Am . Want to cast my vote and leave to work tomorrow morning . Bye have a great day .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one uses internet in their day today life , like a cup of tea . Yes , the world wide web has gain great popularity . I don&#8217;t know , whether the common man have ever thought how the world wide web works ?  Individuals or organizations , publish the details to the public with the help of hosting server . A server is a powerful system , which will be always on , having a dedicated IP address to recognize it in the WWW . There are many types of hosting services . Some are  1 ) Dedicated Hosting  2 ) Virtual Private Server or VPS  3 ) Content Delivery Network or CDN  4 ) Shared Hosting etc.  I am new to the world of hosting. I don&#8217;t run a hosting business too . But , every one will learn when you enter into the web hosting . Yes , I got some space to host my site. There are many free hosting services. The problem&#8217;s with free hosting servies are  1 ) Some provides ad&#8217;s of their own .  2 ) We don&#8217;t know when will they block our site ( as its free it can be removed at any time )  So I thought of getting some space . Now a days I used to read many blogs and sites . From there I was hearing about the terms VPS , Dedicated server , CDN etc .  <strong>Dedicated Server :</strong>In dedicated server, the company has great freedom , for the choice of the operating system , and other software that needs to be installed. The server is dedicated entirely to you and is not shared with any others . For a dedicated hosting the cost is high than that of the VPS .The dedicated servers will be always hosted in some other locations called data centers.  <strong>VPS ( Virtual Private Server )</strong>: A virtual private server means , there will be only one server hardware . Many different operating systems will be installed on it . For eg : After installing a sun solaris os , we may install another operating system ubuntu or some other with the help of virtuaisation softwares like the vmware or virtual box or any other. Each operating systems can be booted with out restarting the server . The hardware will be shared by this virtualisation system . So we may feel , the server is working entirely for us, though its not the case. When some other VPS is over loaded , the other VPS will also have trouble to load their sites. Mainly the VPS is made for small business . But now a days cheap hosting is possible with this VPS . The hosting companies , use a VPS for a small cost . They sell the space for each users , for less amount , but the problem is with the speed and uptime. The server may fail at any moment.You may need to call each time . So going for cheap hosting is not a good solution .  <strong>CDN (Content Delivery Network)</strong> : Content Delivery network is a great solution for those whose web pages have a great traffic. Its huge in cost . I was only aware about the CDN now a days . Though we may be familiar about the term cluster computing we may have not looked seriously. A CDN is nothing but dedicated servers at different locations . Think you have a server at US , India , Europe and some other locations . When a request for a page is from India , you can transfer to the Indian server , when its from America , then to American server. The benefict is greater speed , network traffic will be reduced. A CDN is always a great choice . The ZEND is using the CDN technology to transfer the files. We can recognize how fast it works . But when considering the cost , its some what huge . Its really very interesting to learn how the server works.Really interested to learn about these technologies &#8230;&#8230;..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When the width of the image uploaded to a site is not proper , it may break the design . I have seen many people uploading images of greater width . One thing we can do is to resize the image to a particular size when its uploaded using the php GD graphics library. The php GD graphics library is an awesome one. We can use this library to create captcha images , water mark , rotate and much more.  Yes , now coming to command line . The resizing of an image using command line is pretty simple. Below are the steps which you can use to do this  1 ) Open Terminal / Command prompt / bash shell.( Applications->Accessories->Terminal in Ubuntu )  2 ) Hope you have installed the image magic studio . To try whether its installed , just give the command convert and If you have installed the image magic , then will display a list of options . If you dont have just go to synaptic package manager and install it .( System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager ) , or apt-get will make you install it .  3 ) To resize an image to width of 500 px give the command from prompt $ convert -resize 500 imagename.extension new_image.extension  Eg : convert -resize 500 hari_kt.jpg new_hari.jpg  You can give this command when hari_kt.jpg in the current directory only . Else you can specify the real path . For eg : /home/hari/hari_kt.jpg  If you are new to GNU/LINUX , try to learn some basic commands like ls , pwd , cd , mkdir , rm etc. The mannuals for these are already installed. So just give the command $ man <command name\> .  Eg : man ls ( Press Esc q to quit ) . There is plenty more. But little busy in the next free time will post it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are a web developer or a server admin always communicating to download / upload files, then the Fire FTP is a wonderful addon for the Mozilla Firefox. Some times you may not be having enough permission to install the software . Then you may be trying to contact admin or some one to get it. But don&#8217;t ask any body . Go and get the addon for Mozilla Firefox. Yes, its pretty easy and is a wonderful one . You may love to use it from the browser itself. FTP in one tab and the remaining pages in another . Don&#8217;t need to switch from one FTP client to browser. Is it easy ?  Another FTP client is the Filezilla. Its also a great tool for web developers. Please do try these and you may love it .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of the web developers used to work on windows . The reasons they are used to work are  1 ) Cross browser compatibility : The world wide web is used by different people around the world. You may be an GNU/Linux fan , but people who browse your web pages may be using Internet Explorer. Mozilla firefox is the wondeful browser , that every developer may have seen. It can recognize the css and do the correct things . Safari also recognise to some extent . But what about IE ? hm its a tedious job for the designers and web developers . Some of the css will not be accepted by IE. So when developing a web site we may need to look in different web browsers and test whether it looks the same in all .  2 ) Dreamweaver : Many web developers may be using dream weaver for developing their sites. Dream weaver ofcourse is a wonderful tool . But is a properitery one :-( .  3 ) Photoshop : Many designers may be familiar with photoshop , and have not tried GIMP of the GNU / Linux. I would like to introduce you the wonderful tool GIMP to the web designers. I don&#8217;t know whether you lacks any features. But be proud of using GPL or Open source softwares.     <img src="http://harikt.com/images/banners/Kompozer_wysiwyg_editor.png" title="Kompozer a wysiwyg editor" alt="Kompozer a wysiwyg editor" /> If you using GNU/Linux you may be looking for a dreamweaver like editor . Yes there are a lots of editors in GNU/Linux. Some are vim , emacs, gedit etc. But what about a Graphical User Interface one ? Yes, there a plenty too like the Quanta plus , Blue Fish , Netbeans etc. But misses some in each and every one . Recently I found a wonderful WYSIWYG editor .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of us uses E-commerce sites for online shopping . I don&#8217;t whether they know how these systems work . If you are a web developer or interested to know how this systems work, you can install and try .  Some of the most popular E-commerce softwares are the Oscommerce under the licence of GNU / GPL , Zencart and Magnento . If you are a web developer especially a PHP programmer , you may have heard of these systems. I have tried these three in my local system . Installing these softwares are simple for any one. The requirements for installing the system may vary . But the main requirements are  \1) Apache ( Used mainly in Linux )  2 ) PHP installed  3 ) MySQL database.  If you have PHP version > 5 it will be good, to install all the three . You can see the basic requirements from the sites http://oscommerce.com , http://www.zen-cart.com , http://www.magentocommerce.com/ . Its very easy to learn oscommerce v 2.2 . The main thing I have noticed in oscommerce is it uses the normal coding, not any frame works like zend , symfony, code ignitor or any . I don&#8217;t know whether its my mistake that it uses any ( Version 2.2 ).  The new version 3 for oscommerce is available. But its still in the alpha release . Its using frameworks , jquery , template structure , multiple product images, JSON etc . For more informations you can see in this link http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,132 .  Zen-cart is another powerful e-commerce system which works mostly like oscommerce itslef. The main advantage of zencart is, developers don&#8217;t need to bother about the design much. They can change any code at any time. The change in codes will not effect the design, and any change to design will not effect in its code. The zen-cart has lots of features in the admin side. I have installed both zen-cart and oscommerce. One thing I have noticed in common is the zen-cart and the oscommerce having the same sample datas. I don&#8217;t know how it came so . I think zen-cart is a modified version of os-commerce. Anyway I don&#8217;t get time to explore it. The admin portion of zen-cart has options to show the left nav , right nav , hide these nav when required etc.  Since zen-cart uses template engine customizing zen-cart will be much more easy. All you need to understand the structure, how smarty works etc. Customizing os-commerce needs to edit each and every page. Its some what a tedious one thanzen-cart. This is what I feel, and its all upto you to decide the e-commerce system which you needs.  Coming to Magento , the newly born award winning e-commerce system from the source-forge in 2008 , uses good features of the todays PHP , javascript and all. But needs a good server to run this. Else to load a page may take a long time. It has great features, like managing multiple stores. I don&#8217;t know its architecture . Not able to look deeply . Anyway onething I am sure its uses some frame work.  Magento is a wonderful ecommerce system , that every one will love on the installation itself. But its some what hard to recognise the codes. It has a lots of features. Some of the great features I liked which is missing in oscommerce , zencart is manage multiple stores . May be due to this reason many website owners like this. You can see a list of features of magento http://www.magentocommerce.com/features here .  The demo for each systems are there . So if you like to see the demos of oscommerce systems . You can go and try it, before installing the system in your server .  <strong>http://demo</strong>.<strong>oscommerce</strong>.com/  http://www.magentocommerce.com/demo  <strong>http://demo</strong>.opensourcecms.com/<strong>zencart</strong>  There may be more e-commerce systems , so if you need more you can explore sourceforge or opensourcecms.com is also a good site to see the demo and list of opensource and GNU / GPL softwares.</p>
