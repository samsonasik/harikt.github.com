  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi guys, have you heard about Neon ? Probably no I guess.  Neon is the project by David Grudl (http://davidgrudl.com) which is part of Nette Framework (http://nette.org) . I recently found Neon , but it was not in github for people may not have noticed that much. Also David Grudl tweets almost everything in Czech. So I assume he may be having less followers in twitter who speaks English or any language other than Czech. But he is an awesome guy who has some awesome projects. One of it is <a href="http://ne-on.org/">Neon</a> and the other one is Texy . I will cover texy in another post.  You can create the php array from json, yaml etc with Neon . See the example below we are parsing as a json and getting $data as array . And then later we are encoding it and you will get Yaml. You can see the live demo at Neon website : http://ne-on.org/  {syntaxhighlighter class=&#8221;php&#8221;} $data = Neon::decode(&#8217; { &#8220;repo&#8221;: [ { &#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;resque&#8221; }, { &#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;hub&#8221; }, { &#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;rip&#8221; }, ] } &#8216;); print_r($data); echo &#8217;   * * * * *  &#8216;; $neon = Neon::encode($data, Neon::BLOCK); {/syntaxhighlighter} PHP array  {syntaxhighlighter class=&#8221;php&#8221;} Array ( [repo] => Array ( [0] => Array ( [name] => resque ) [1] => Array ( [name] => hub ) [2] => Array ( [name] => rip ) ) ) repo: - name: resque - name: hub - name: rip {/syntaxhighlighter}  You can see the source code at https://github.com/harikt/Neon for David Grudl has not kept in github. You can get more details from Neon Website http://ne-on.org/</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OAuth the future of login? People are bored of registering and remebering user passwords on different websites. So the future of OAuth or using it in your daily life when developing website or apps is not that much far. Already many websites have been using it. This book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021810.do">Getting Started with OAuth 2.0</a> by Ryan Boyd published by O&#8217;Reilly Media is an awesome must read book. The author Ryan is a developer advocate at Google focused on enabling developers to extend Google Apps and build businesses on top of Google technology. He previously worked on OpenSocial and led the developer relations team for Google’s AtomPub APIs. Ryan has a great of knowledge of what he is talking about. The concepts of oauth was easy to understand, he has provided enough examples on how to use it in PHP, Javascript and HTML. I have already written an article at phpmaster<a href="http://phpmaster.com/integrating-with-facebook/">integrating facebook with php</a>. So if you ever thought of integrating oauth 2.0, its good to learn the concepts, so you can just relay on Http client library. Its a small 65 page book, but is worth . The book doesn&#8217;t include or teach you how you can create your own oauth server , that is ok for its getting started with oauth. This book deserves a Rating of : 10 / 10 . Anything more you need to know?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>UPDATE 30-03-2012: Fabien Potencier made the necessary <a href="http://harikt.com/comment/510#comment-510">changes to move the tests</a> to each components source folder. <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/fea6b79acdf01b79ac3d3206c001a9dec662da93">See commit</a> . That&#8217;s a great move from Symfony&#8217;s part . But what will happen to at Zend Framework?  The most awesome discussion that is happening in PHP world is recognizing the importance of <a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/blog/2012/03/packages-the-way-forward-for-php">Components or Packages</a>. Bernhard Schussek even wrote a post on <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/">Symfony2 Form Architecture</a> and I wrote my thoughts and understanding on <a href="http://harikt.com/standalone-form-component-for-php">Standalone Form component for PHP</a>.  I would like to share the image of the low level architecture of the Symfony2 Form component from his post, uploaded to flickr for his bandwidth will not have any trouble.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/6819330426/" title="class-diagram2 by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6819330426_359a8e4298.jpg" alt="class-diagram2" /></a>  So to conclude the Symfony Form has a minimal dependencies of Event Dispatcher which even can be replaced by writing a custom one that implements Symfony2 &#8216;s <a href="https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher/blob/master/EventDispatcherInterface.php">EventDispatcherInterface</a> .  > @<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> ah yeah.

I used to hang on in IRC of every channels, as my level of understanding and there are more awesome people who are better than me, I speak less there :-) , so feel free to correct here if you think at any point I am wrong. Looking from outside both Symfony2 and ZF2 is full of standalone components. But the reality is not the same. Though Symfony2 components are split into each components in github, you cannot give a pull request to that component. The tests for all the components still resides in the <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/tree/master/tests/Symfony/Tests/Component">core</a>. The same will be applying to <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/tree/master/tests/Zend">Zend Framework 2</a> ( ZF2 ) too. I wrote my concern on the topic in mailing list of Symony2, if you are interested you can read on it <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/symfony-devs/CuwDO8LhReQ/discussion">here</a>.  Let&#8217;s leave the contributions or pull requests, if I / you are trying to integrate Symfony form component to your project or library, we want to bring the tests some how make the necessary changes to the core if I want to make use of Event Dispatcher / Signal or another like Aura or Zend. Try to make how you can render in your view if I am using <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View">Aura View</a> or Zend or even in <a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/phly_mustache">phly_mustache</a>.  So let me tell you the design principle to make them as standalone have some failure. Coming back to Aura, as a small contributor I can see Paul M Jones right decision to make the component library has more to speak. The good thing is Aura has all the tests in one place for the component. For eg: consider <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Router">Aura Router the routing component</a>. The source lies in src folder , the tests in tests folder.  The design principles of <a href="http://phix-project.org">phix-project.org</a> by Stuart Herbert is also a good when looking into it. So if you mentions its standalone, it should be easy to setup, easy to contribute etc. The Aura components have no depedencies on any of the components, and I feel the same will happen for the remaining Form, Filtering components which are still to be born. I wonder how Zend can make use of Symfony2, or do you mean a copy and paste of the components and changing namespace giving credits to it and making the necessary changes ? I don&#8217;t know more on the MIT licence and is that what they want.  Please don&#8217;t think I am disrespect to any of you, for I love the PHP community. <a href="http://blog.phpdeveloper.org">Chris Cornutt (@enygma) on Twitter</a> voiced his opinion on the decisions made by both Zend and Symfony community of using Zend_Log ( If you don&#8217;t <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/#comment-17698">please have a look</a> ).  Update : I am not telling about installing dependencies for a project . Aura itself is using composer.json , so people can download it via composer and you can browse it from  packagist.org . My point was making use of different compoents from different Vendors with out dependencies on the other . For eg using Aura View, Symfony Form and Zend Validator , and if there is less dependencies and as I told if all tests reside at the same components github repo it makes life easier for developers to push and pull stuffs. Consider the movement of Drupal using Symfony components . Does Drupal 8 uses Symfony as a whole ? No its using some of the core components . So if they want to push something they can do easily. I want to dig more on composer to learn whether there is anything other than installation composer can do .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I was reading the post <a href="http://webmozarts.com/2012/03/06/symfony2-form-architecture/">Symfony2 Form Architecture</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/webmozart">Bernhard Schussek</a> . The main aim of his post was to make use of Symfony2 form component in Zend Framework 2 as the form architecture which was written in <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC+-+Forms">RFC</a> seems almost the same. This is a small feedback I would love to give as I am interested to make the Form as a standalone component, what ever framework we are using.  These all started with probably @fabpot tweets about it .     > Is it just me or is the <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23ZF2">#ZF2</a> > form RFC heavily inspired by > <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Symfony2">#Symfony2</a>? /cc > @<a href="https://twitter.com/webmozart">webmozart</a> > <a href="http://t.co/cRf01a3X" title="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV2/RFC+-+Forms">framework.zend.com/wiki/display/Z…</a> > > — Fabien Potencier (@fabpot) > <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot/status/174153351372611584">February 27, 2012</a>     Some months back as of Symfony2 stable was released I tried to incorporate the Form component to <a href="https://github.com/auraphp">Aura Project for PHP</a> which was aiming for 5.3 at that time. But now looking forward to 5.4 + only  Let have a look into the Symfony2 dependencies for Form component which is described in pear.symfony.com   EventDispatcher, Validator, Locale .  AuraPHP already have a Signal / Slot / Event Handler , so it doesn&#8217;t need the EventDispatcher, like the same ZF2 already have one, so I feel EventDispatcher is not needed for both the frameworks. Lets don&#8217;t think what we have, lets see whether adding these components really solve in creating to make it as a standalone component ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/6813319456/" title="Sf2Form by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7055/6813319456_3441d6be49.jpg" alt="Sf2Form" /></a>  I have taken a screenshot of the tweets I got in reply. Thanks to all who tried to help me .Below is the link to the details, and I hope you can go more detailed on the tweets if needed.  > @<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> You don&#8217;t need Twig. Simply > the Twig form rendering is easier to get standalone. the PHP one is > in the bundle @<a href="https://twitter.com/weaverryan">weaverryan</a> > @<a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot">fabpot</a> > > — Christophe Coevoet (@Stof70) > <a href="https://twitter.com/Stof70/status/142643884047089664">December 2, 2011</a>     So what is missing for Symfony2 form component ? It needs more components as shown in the gist  below     So to conclude though the Symfony2 Form mentions as a standalone, its not a standalone component at-least looking from a user point of view like me. You can see various people asking about how to use Symfony2 Form component as a standalone in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/symfony-users/aAqDJjkl2gQ">google groups</a>. But what people points is to Silex again build on the shoulder of Symfony2 component . I am not against Symfony2 , please don&#8217;t feel so. But I just want to bring the fact that, than writing a big architecture, people would be looking how we can integrate it as standalone .  So in my view I am looking forward to see how ZF2 will make a change from Symfony2 or will it be the same like binding everything . I am also looking forward to see how <a href="http://auraphp.github.com">Aura project for PHP 5.4</a> can bring Form . I have limited knowledge, so I may be wrong on the above things too. Feel free to correct me  I am looking for something like the one below, yes of-course we need validation and stuffs , but it will be standalone , no matter :-) .      &lt;?php     //PFBC 2.x PHP 5 >= 5.3     session_start();     include($<em>SERVER[&#8220;DOCUMENT_ROOT&#8221;] . &#8220;/PFBC/Form.php&#8221;);     $form = new PFBC\Form(&#8220;GettingStarted&#8221;, 300);     $form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Textbox(&#8220;My Textbox:&#8221;, &#8220;MyTextbox&#8221;));     $form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Select(&#8220;My Select:&#8221;, &#8220;MySelect&#8221;, array(        &#8220;Option #1&#8221;,        &#8220;Option #2&#8221;,        &#8220;Option #3&#8221;     )));     $form->addElement(new PFBC\Element\Button);     $form->render();      //PFBC 2.x PHP 5     session_start();     include($</em>SERVER[&#8220;DOCUMENT_ROOT&#8221;] . &#8220;/PFBC/Form.php&#8221;);     $form = new Form(&#8220;GettingStarted&#8221;, 300);     $form->addElement(new Element_Textbox(&#8220;My Textbox:&#8221;, &#8220;MyTextbox&#8221;));     $form->addElement(new Element_Select(&#8220;My Select:&#8221;, &#8220;MySelect&#8221;, array(        &#8220;Option #1&#8221;,        &#8220;Option #2&#8221;,        &#8220;Option #3&#8221;     )));     $form->addElement(new Element_Button);     $form->render();     ?>  An example where I can show such a standalone one is http://code.google.com/p/php-form-builder-class/ . Currently to render the form either you need <a href="https://github.com/symfony/TwigBridge">TwigBridge</a> or <a href="https://github.com/symfony/FrameworkBundle">FrameworkBundle</a> .  > @<a href="https://twitter.com/harikt">harikt</a> There is 2 implementations: > TwigBridge and in FrameworkBundle but you could write one for > Aura.View /cc @<a href="https://twitter.com/webmozart">webmozart</a> > > — Christophe Coevoet (@Stof70) > <a href="https://twitter.com/Stof70/status/177148060881788929">March 6, 2012</a>  If you are using Framework bundle you need <a href="https://github.com/symfony/FrameworkBundle/blob/master/Templating/Helper/FormHelper.php">Templating component</a> and to my understanding if you are using TwigBundle you need Twig itself . So is this a standalone ? Also if its really a standalone why it didn&#8217;t find a documentation as in http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/index.html . The Symfony2 has released months back, so I don&#8217;t feel Symfony2 form is a standalone in the sense as I shown in the example .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I wrote a post on how autoloading works, and the current standard implemented by the PHP community the PSR-0 standard autoloader which is used by Symfony2 , Lithium , Zend , Aura etc .  You can read more on the post <a href="http://phpmaster.com/autoloading-and-the-psr-0-standard/">Autoloading in PHP and the PSR-0 Standard</a> .  If you are using PHP 5.4 , <a href="http://auraphp.github.com/Aura.Autoload/">Aura Autoload</a> also provides a <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0 Standard</a> SPL autoloader implementation for PHP. It also matches the proposed <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/splclassloader">SplClassLoader</a> interface.  Thank you once again for sitepoint and the whole team giving me an opporchunity to make this post available to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Aura Project for PHP 5.4 releases Beta2 for the components. Now all the Aura packages are releases via release tool which makes it automated way. Currently Aura Components can be installed via composer and github. We will soon release the pear packages once the new phar file is released by Pyrus which includes the fix for creating packages with dot. See https://github.com/pyrus/Pyrus/issues/75 Don&#8217;t think this as the official announcement . Official announcement will be posted by <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com">Paul M Jones the lead for Aura PHP</a> Source Code : https://github.com/auraphp Update : So Paul M Jones officially declared the <a href="http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/2277">Release of Aura 1.0.0-beta2</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have already have read the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920001096.do">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a> by Kristina Chodorow and Michael Dirolf . It doesn&#8217;t cover much on the PHP, but its a good book to learn about MongoDB and how it works in Depth. Once I saw the book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do">MongoDB and PHP</a> by Steve Francia I was planning to buy it, and the time I got a chance to signup for the blogger review program by O&#8217;Reilly Media. Its a small book of 60 pages, but a good one. I will rate 7.5 / 10 , a good read for PHP Developers . If you wondered why the 2.5 is missing read on  I have little experience playing with MongoDB and <a href="http://lithify.me">Lithium framework</a> . I loved to give an 8 / 10 for the book really . But the reason why I didn&#8217;t gave is as its a small book with 61 pages, its really a good way to include installation of MongoDb in atleast one Operating System ( Ubuntu preferred ) . As its not a big pain to install MongoDb in ubuntu its really a good thing :-) . The author Steve has been working with open sky and now with 10gen, and has good experience with MongoDB and PHP . He has presented it nicely, though there are some places need some more clarifications for people new to MongoDB. Even I say its a 60 page book, you cannot just read it in a 3 Hours if you really start playing with it and understanding each and everything .  Some questions I felt in reading page 26 is &#8220;If you want to retrieve only the slice itself and not the entire document, you can come pretty close by retrieving the _id and the slice&#8221; with the example      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( &#8216;first_name&#8217; => &#8216;Peter&#8217;, &#8216;last_name&#8217; => &#8216;Parker&#8217;),         array(&#8217;<em>id&#8217; => 1, &#8216;superpowers&#8217; => array(&#8216;$slice&#8217; => 2)))     );  The above will give you      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )     )  The above was the only example, but I was thinking something more . What will happen when _id is set to 0 like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( &#8216;first_name&#8217; => &#8216;Peter&#8217;, &#8216;last_name&#8217; => &#8216;Parker&#8217;),         array(&#8217;<em>id&#8217; => 0, &#8216;superpowers&#8217; => array(&#8216;$slice&#8217; => 2)))     );  it returns      Array     (         [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )         [zip] => 10010     )  and what about _id when removed like      print_r($addresses->findone(         array( &#8216;first_name&#8217; => &#8216;Peter&#8217;, &#8216;last_name&#8217; => &#8216;Parker&#8217;),         array(&#8216;superpowers&#8217; => array(&#8216;$slice&#8217; => 2)))     );  will return      Array     (         [</em>id] => MongoId Object             (                 [$id] => 4f2e1b9caa6a477739000000             )          [address] => 175 Fifth Ave         [city] => New York         [first_name] => Peter         [last_name] => Parker         [state] => NY         [superpowers] => Array             (                 [0] => agility                 [1] => stamina             )          [zip] => 10010     )  Somethings like this are left to user to think why its so ? Some example like &#8216;Clark Kent&#8217; was never created, nor I remember whether he mentios to create new ones. It would have been a good idea to mention to insert new ones as the book teaches how to do it. The other one which confuses me about Indexing , ie whether I want to run the method ensureindex each and every time or only once Eg :     $db->numbers->ensureindex(array( &#8216;num&#8217; => 1 ));  But once you finish reading the book carefully, you will definitely can use MongoDB for your next project . He covers different types of ODM for MongoDB. For further information look into the product page at http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022381.do</p>
