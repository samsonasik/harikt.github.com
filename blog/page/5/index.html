  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was introduced to the world of Internet after my 10th standard examination. Was not having a computer at home, so just browse a few hours a month or around 6 month time. But later when I got my first AMD Athlon ( When I am doing my BTech in IT) , I got a start-up pack. From there onwards I am addicted to computers and internet. I hope its not me now , but the whole world is addicted either with social media websites or something like me :) . So we need a good internet provider. I do have a BSNL landline 500 C plan, which I use less as I move from Cochin , Trivandrum, Bangalore , Chennai etc . I have been using BSNL EVDO which offers a 2Mbps connection ( I bought the device for 4500 :P ) . When I was taking the connection was better, but later I feel due to the introduction of BSNL 3G the poor connectivity and resolving issues was high. The customer service is a hell and I was trying to switch to a 3G connection for I want to buy the device only once or I can use my Samsung Galaxy Android set ;) . Looking for a 3G provider in my locality I came to know that the only one currently is BSNL . Aaah hell , the first thing came to me :) . Today I went to buy a SIM to try different 2G and 3G speeds. The first one I tried currently is Vodafone. I was offered the system to have a look into the demo. Great , and I did some testing Tested Vodafone in Calicut : 1 ) Going for google.com :) . 2 ) speedtest.net 3 ) Opening 2 terminals Start -> Run -> CMD {syntaxhighlighter BASH} ping -t google.com tracert google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} I am big fan of *nix systems . But the one which is provided for demo is Windows ie why the commands :) . For people who want to try in *nix From terminal {syntaxhighlighter BASH} $ traceroute google.com $ ping google.com {/syntaxhighlighter} Why I put a ping -t is for continous ping for windows. Else it will stop after 4 pings . Speedtest for vodafone 3G was impressive . I don&#8217;t remember the exact time , but download was around 2 Mps I guess and Upload of .11 Mbps ( Sorry if it was wrong ) But tracert and ping was taking more time :( . Anyway I thought of buying a SIM and go for a test from my home. Got one , charged for 2G plan , connected :D . Oh horrible . Changed DNS from googles, 8.8.8.8 , 8.8.4.4 and open-dns 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220 . Oh my hm . But the one of the most impressive thing is just on a tweet they are ready to know and help. That&#8217;s a caring customer service . Hands of to that , that&#8217;s impressive . So I am searching for a good internet provider, and you may already have seen lots of posts on the blog http://ijust4u.blogspot.com . But writing this post here is I have more visitors to this website than the other and if you are not subscribed to the other one I will never get an answer for my Question. Please do the ping and tracert commands from Windows . Ctrl + C to exit ping , let it take ping for 10-20 minutes . Please share the screen shots some where and comment on the post with the links . Lets find the best provider which can server internet . I am not looking for Reliance connect , Tata Photon like services for I want to buy the device and also its not available in Kunnamangalam also its a lock as I suffer now with the EVDO 4500 gone :) . So you can check in 2G mode or in 3G do let me know . Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mercury Editor : So going through the Symfony CMF post on <a href="http://liip.ch">Liip Blog</a> I came accross a nice editor Mercury. Mercury is a full featured HTML5 editor like Aloha Editor . You can download or see it in action over : http://jejacks0n.github.com/mercury/ I am impressed on the first look, awesome :) . Fluid Baseline : Another project I was impressed is the <a href="http://fluidbaselinegrid.com/">Fluid Baseline grid</a> . It may be good that you go and look in browser with different sizes. Some properties are Fluid Columns, Baseline Grid, Responsive Design. Go and see dude :) . Impressive .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working for awhile, and as a developer these are the things that I think will boost the productivity especially if its a start-up. These are some of my thoughts there may be more things to add ( missed once ), or I may add later when I experience those, so on the future if I am starting a startup, that will help me :) . 1 ) Project Management Tool : The one the first thing we need is a project management tool. I am in favour of redmine.org, though its on Ruby on Rails. Hard for a PHP Developer to setup first. But it has lots of features. As I am a PHP Developer , I loved if I can make a port of it . Writing a project management tool is one of my dream. You can view source, see commits , create issues, dead lines, activity oh my awesome . No words simply awesome. 2 ) Operating System : A flavour of Debain. Probably Ubuntu ;) . If yours is a start-up, then moving behind a properitery software like Windows or MAC will eat your money. Not just money, the productivity decreases a lot. I have experience working on Windows and GNU/Linux OS. The Windows-7 eats up a lot of memory . No I am not blaming Microsoft , don&#8217;t think like that. But when it comes to performance and productivity its easier to work on command lines. A good example is mysql import of a database , export of a database . Deploying to production etc. So the developer will be more familiar than seeing it for the first time. As a developer, never go for a designing level tool like Dreamweaver to code your PHP. I don&#8217;t have any issues, but it will be hard to move once you are used to it . May be you will introduce the term user friendliness :D . I remember Richard Stallmann saying about it :) on an event in Calicut. Go for Netbeans, Eclipse PDT or Zend Studio or your loved once ( After its upto you who uses it ;) ). A good choice is let your developer move on to use his favourite distro and setup it . Just give the necessary hardware :) . 3 ) Version Control System : Of-course a VCS is necessary . I usually go for git, until I heard an interesting speech about Subversion 1.7 and the future features by Senthil Kumaran S. Yes he made it more clear where to go for SVN and GIT. If you have collobaration with other companies and only some parts need to be gone out, go for SVN. The problem with git is all will be having the working tree . ( Correct me if I am wrong ) . Tracking the commits is easy and we can monitor the activity in redmine &#8230; Wow isn&#8217;t ? 4 ) Clients : Without Clients , we don&#8217;t need all these tools , so yes clients play a good role. To make a client/ customer happy is the goal of the organization. Organization means from top to bottom. There will be always communication issues when you work from different places . Yes after all we are humans, ego , anger so and so .. Client has ideas , but developer need to execute to the awesomeness. How can we make it ? When I learned about Software Engineering on my 5th semester B.Tech it was the horrible subject I have ever seen. Lots of theories, and sometimes I even never understood where I want this . Yes those olden days :) . Yes so software life cycles play a good role in the process. But we should build the process, and not just follow some process vaguely . You must be aware what we are going to deliver etc . So a good thing is create a mock up . Yes lots of open-source tools available one I like to mention is a Firefox addon Pencil . You can grab it over http://pencil.evolus.vn/ . So wireframed :D. Now you know the steps fields and everything . Execute . Split into small tasks, create a dead line for each task. Yes I know its hard to do, eats so much time , but this always brings a good product . Suggestions and improvements will make a good product. Go with the trends than the old ones . For eg : Still developing with old 5.2 frameworks when we have the awesome 5.3 Framework ? 5 ) Database : The most horrible one I have ever seen is migrating database from development to production. Yes I know you may tell about Doctrine Migrations, Db Deply etc http://dbdeploy.com/ . If you are the administrator of the server and is able to install softwares , then don&#8217;t hesitate to switch from DBMS to Mongo or Couch if its suitable . There will always occur a time to port from one to the other . Go for utf-8 collation, if its international , InnoDb for relationships, MyISAM for fast text search so and so . Know what you need, DB is the foundation , so once you laid , its always good that there is no changes needed, or atleast least . Don&#8217;t forget to choose the right type for the field. I have seen people adding VARCHAR instead of DATE even the type is supported . What to tell Fuck ! . 6 ) Frameworks : Ofcourse not the last , but frameworks helps us a lot . If you start maintaining a website you will really understand the pitfalls. I learned many things looking over the code. There is always good and bad done by others. Looking closely and learn the good and improving the bad help you a lot. For eg : Lets assume a newbie coming and starting a sample blog, if he is using a framework , it may be automatically adding the necessary things to protect CSRF attacks, sometimes validations stuffs etc . This helps a lot even he is not aware what CSRF is. Modelling is hard, love active record implementation .. But :) . 7 ) Good Developers : Good to have self motivated developers. Go from Juniors to Seniors . This will increase productivity a lot. If you have ever wondered how productivity increases , then I can show its easy. Juniors can work on the edit / update / delete / view the borring functionality developer needs to do. There by learning good things for a Junior . Seniors can concentrate on API design or any other logic implementations . 8 ) Unit Testing : There is a huge advantage for unit tests. According to my knowledge there is 1% of the companies write unit tests . Unit testing is always a great boom if it needs to be maintained. I know I have been blamed even I wrote a tutorial on Zend Framework. But I am happy for that , for I looked or started learning from it. You know what breaks , and where it breaks , awesome !! .Always push your developer to write unit test, never go without it :D . 9 ) API and Documentation : Always good to have the methods and classes well documented , there should never arise a confusion why I wrote it . 10 ) Work Space and Atmosphere : i ) A good atmosphere and calm place always brings creativity . I remember the post on Joel on Software . Yes awesome one, love the way . ii ) 5 day work and Flexibility : We all are humans , working for 6 days on a tight schedule will loose our creativity and innovation. So its always good to go for 5 day working company. Peace of mind will bring more productivity and innovations. About the flexibility , some people will love to work on nights , but some on days, some may want to go in the middle. If the tasks are being split and there is no dependency for other people , then flexibility is a good option else mmmm it sucks. Yes I know all these eat up time , but for a better maintainable software time it needed :) . Lets not use and throw the product, like use and throw. Don&#8217;t forget to contribute back to the open-source tools you use, either by code or $ . You earn from it , let those who develop it also make a living , be human. Note : Please add in your comments if I missed anything , I can add to this . Thanks</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little about Symfony2 :  Symfony2 is a PHP 5.3 framework which follows the PSR-0 working group standard , which is also a fully rewrite after Symfony 1.X series .  Why I think Symfony2 the future of PHP :  Symfony2 is a framework build on top of different components. You can also build your own framework utilizing those Symfony2 components. Supports Database and Document based via Doctrine project ( Not reinventing wheel ). Great support for Twig a templating engine and PHP . I love templating engine for certain reasons. For eg ; Providing SAS we can make use of templating engine ;) . So we don&#8217;t want to bother too much on the security aspects. ( If I am wrong correct me )  Symfony2 is the only PHP 5.3 framework which is released so far as I know ( not development, nor Alpha or Beta I am talking ).  A great community with great active development, which can utilize other PSR-0 components and library. You can see over the commits https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commits/master . I never have ever seen such a dedicated commits coming . Hands of to <a href="http://twitter.com/fabpot">@Fabpot</a> for the great effort he has made. But there are more <a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/contributors">contributors</a>. But what I was mentioning was without a leader there will be nothing happening . I think the Symfony community will agree with this point .  Many of the Symfony2 components are already used by other PHP communities like <a href="http://blog.phpbb.com/2010/02/18/moving-on-the-future-of-phpbb-development/">PHPBB</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1178246">Drupal</a> etc .  A <a href="http://cmf.symfony.com/">Content Management Framework</a> is coming along the way . You can see who all are <a href="http://cmf.symfony.com/about">dedicated</a> to bring the next generation CMS. You can also join and be part of the movement.  Its utilizing PHPCR - Content Repository for PHP a great effort to port the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java">JCR</a> You can learn more from http://phpcr.github.com/ .  One more giant framework is coming Flow3 which will be the next framework for Typo3 version 5. It also have some of the same concepts from Symfony2 and utilizes Doctrine project . I played with it some weeks back and its on beta, what I feel is its multilingual support is coming on the way . But I am sure Typo3 Version 5 will surely support multilingualism. But isn&#8217;t it good to start with Symfony?  Note :  I know Fuel is released and supports PHP 5.3 , but its not PSR-0 standard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some weeks back I finished the book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/kohana-3-0-for-professional-web-applications-beginners-guide/book">Kohana 3.0 Beginner&#8217;s Guide</a>. As the name suggests its so simple that anyone new to PHP can learn Kohana. Yes I recommend learning a framework if you are a PHP Developer . It has lots of advantages, that you will come across in your development life.( Not going deep on it ) . The author of the book is Jason D. Straughan, published by Packt. As a reviewer I must be open, so its open from the mind. I love packt and have no issues with the author ( I don&#8217;t know him personally nor have any grudge ), but for a buyer its not like that. So forgive me. I started reading the book with a great enthusiasm, though its not a 5.3 framework, but to learn the principles and learn the good things of HMVC. Its annoying for a newbie if you see some errata&#8217;s even though he doesn&#8217;t know its an errata. The single quotes and double quotes have issues almost many parts of the book. Yes we can say the books code is online, so correction is easy. So I am not talking anymore about the Errata&#8217;s . Because there are some :), may be due to the format issues arised when sending back and forth . The book talks about Kohana version 3.0. But the current version is 3.2 . There is compatibility issues with 3.2, 3.0 . Not sure about 3.1 though . I played downloading 3.2 and I was stuck. The books page 312 mentions about the support for each release . So after each 6 months new versions will come and the support is for 1 year. Around the 5th chapter it introduce the ORM used in Kohana and I loved that chapter . The missing things I love to see in the book are Ajax support, or how ajax support is achieved, named routing. ie without the module/controller/action/id stuffs. This is always the default one. As its a hard to do with an open-source book to maintain the pace the code is pumped I feel Packt want to follow the way http://progit.org/ . So a book for the community and will be brought by people , so always upto date and correct . Writing a book is hard, but for a reader he must not be aware, but just the contents . Download Sample Chapter : http://bit.ly/qT14Hi Beginner Level Programmer ( Ignoring Errata ) : 3 / 5 Moderate Developer Rate : 2 / 5 . Personal Opinion is Packt should take much more seriousness before publishing open-source books for the life span of writing the book may go and the software may have started another version. Also there are a lots of good books by Packt, which are being burried due to the opinions people raising against the low quality books like this. Feel free to correct me, always good to get in touch with the open-source community leader and ask suggestions before jumping to publish a book. You have some good stuffs missing like Mongo , Couch , Developing a multilingual website from scratch etc. Great topics on the list . On Symfony2 Beginners guide , Advanced and lots :) . Don&#8217;t dump it, colloborate and bring it we are waiting :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some months back I read the article <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/12584">php|architect&#8217;s guide to Web Scraping with PHP - Don&#8217;t let the title fool you</a>. It was a review for the <a href="http://www.phparch.com/books/phparchitects-guide-to-web-scraping-with-php/">book</a> of Mathew Turland ( <a href="http://twitter.com/elazar">@elazar</a> ) by Cal Evans . But I didnot read the book too . Days passes I saw <a href="https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte">Goutte</a> a simple web scrapper by @fabpot (  <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org">Fabien Potentier</a> ) .  But two days back I was looking how I can download my friends contact details from facebook. I didnot find a means to get the mobile numbers or email address. I looked the API , but it didnot provide some functionalities like that . Then what to do ?  If I have got the email and phone number I can sync with my gmail and via it to my android handset . But I didnot find anything , may be other softwares will be there . But I simply thought of learning scraping than going to do something .  Goutte is a simple library which can be downloaded as a phar file also. So you just want to add a require for the phar file . It utilises some of the symfony components and zend http component . You can login , select links , clicks on it , filter the content , fetch data etc.  I was able to make the script going through some of the articles below .  Read me of https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte  http://www.phparch.com/2010/04/four-new-php-5-3-components-and-goutte-a-simple-web-scraper/  http://fabien.potencier.org/article/42/parsing-xml-documents-with-css-selectors  Also the api :) . Its really a powerful php scraping tool. Yes its easy if you know how the css selectors work .  Download Goutte over https://github.com/fabpot/Goutte or using wget https://raw.github.com/fabpot/Goutte/master/goutte.phar . Start scraping :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You don&#8217;t want to be a strong C programmer to contribute to PHP. You just need to know some XML to contriute to the documentation of PHP and improve it . Recently I was going through some of the functions . I noticed an example which was not for that function. There was a link just next to it to file a Bug . Though I clicked and moved , I didn&#8217;t felt it as a huge issue to report as Bug . I came back to the page and saw the edit on the top right . Clicked on it and went to edit . I logged in with my open-id , though the docbook didn&#8217;t redirected me , I just logged in as annonymous . I made the necessary changes .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/6065016304/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6065016304_574fec7e1a.jpg" alt="image" /></a>  Though it says it saved , I didnot see it reflected quickly . I guess some of the peers need to review it and push to see it . Anyway what I want you guys of PHP community is rather than filing a bug in documentation if you know what to do , then go for an edit . This will help the people of our PHP community rather than looking what the bug is verifying it, then assigning a person if he is not familiar with that language etc. I am writing this post for I noticed the same thing . If I had made the bug rather than editing the appropriate files the number of bugs will increase . After all the person who does the documentation is doing things as a community effort and not paid for it. Let us try to help those people, after all we all are in PHP and enjoying the awesome Language. You can also vote for the bugs so that will help the core developers to do the needful .</p>
