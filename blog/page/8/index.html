  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have used google chrome , you may have loved its simple menu, navigation etc. I love to make firefox somthing similar to google chrome .  Some firefox addons is necessary to change mozilla firefox look somthing similar to google chrome .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532378436/" title="make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4532378436_76b73c6a55.jpg" alt="make firefox having google chrome look" /></a>  Addons Needed  1 ) We need to hide the menu, so you can download <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4762</a>  2 ) Download Personnas , so you can dress mozilla firefox in different looks . You can get it from <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/">http://www.getpersonas.com/</a>  After downloading and installing addons, you need to restart firefox .  Steps involved  1 ) Tick only the navigation toolbar , ie Goto Views -> Toolbars -> Click on Navigation Toolbar ( If the menu is not showing you can use Alt + F , Alt + T, Alt + v , will make you jump to Views menu or use your favourite short cut keys )  2 ) Customize your navigation tool bar . ie Goto Views -> Toolbars -> Customize  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4532380282/" title="make firefox having google chrome look by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4532380282_435c3ee8c2.jpg" alt="make firefox having google chrome look" /></a>  Here you can drag and dropthe things from the navigation . ie where we type the url and all . The left side buttons are draggable and dropped the other window . Try draggind and dropping  .  3 ) Enable Groovy Blue theme for the personnas ( for the bueish look ) or you can create a small image of the same colour of google chrome navigation  and dress your browser, creating new personnas :).  So the final look will be something like the one I showed at the top. Hope you like it :) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This Saturday April 10th 2010 , two big events are going to happen in Kerala . If you were following me in twitter you may have noticed it . 1 ) Google Technology User&#8217;s Group and 2 ) The Adobe Users Group launch event .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497299898/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4497299898_9872bb6922.jpg" alt="Google Technology Users Group Launch Event at Technopark" /></a>  I am Happy that kerala is also getting some user groups . Previously Bangalore was the hub and now we can see small groups peeping here and there all over kerala. The GTUG event venue is UST Global6th Floor (Zentith Hall) ,Bhavani,Technopark , Trivandrum. Timing is between 10 AM to 1 PM .   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4497302818/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4497302818_ffcec8241d.jpg" alt="Adobe Kerla Users Group Launch Event at Cochin" /></a>  Adobe Users Group Launch event is at Woods Manor Hotel , Cochin. I loved to attend both the events , but both on the same day at different locations . Though I am at cochin I will be moving to technopark , Trivandrum for the GTUG launch event. If you was following me , you may have seen my tweet some days back. I am little late to post in my blog due to certain reasons. The seats for both the events are limited and for the GTUG I think its almost finished . I am not sure about the Adobe event . So you guys can look both the events and can be part of your loving group . You can get more details about Adobe Users Group from <a href="http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/">http://godsowndevelopers.com/kad/launchevent/</a> and the Kerala Google Technology Users group from <a href="http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/">http://www.kerala-gtug.org/30/launch-event/</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mar Athanasios College For Advanced Studies ( MACFAST ) hosted the eighth Barcamp of Kerala.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4470034917/" title="mar athanasios college for advanced studies by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4470034917_023d0cc7af.jpg" alt="mar-athanasios-college-for-advanced-studies" /></a>  It may be the one of the only college which runs a radio. Got pictures from@deepakp7 and @arunbasillal . The college was the sponsor of BCK8 and he offered us to be there at any time we want. We are really Thankful for the Management and the Principal Father Abraham Mulamootil.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4469923633/" title="campus-radio-macfast by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4469923633_53e3c445fe.jpg" alt="campus-radio-macfast" /></a>  Entrepreneurship by Adv. Ivin Gancius was the one I loved, though the presentation was not so colourful. He answered many of the questions raised by the attendees. The other one was Statistical Machine Translation by @deepakp7. He demonstrated how the translations are working and all with some examples. This time @shwetank( The evangelist of opera ) disappointed me. The session registered was The HTML5 Bandwagon and he went with Mobile Web. I was expecting something similar to the awesome presentation made by him at BCK5, Technopark Trivandrum.  Y Perl? by Alan Haggai Alavi was also an interesting one. He was interested to show more stuffs related to Perl if any of us are willing to learn. There was other sessions like Spara - Energy Conservation Product by Deepa Eswar. You may be knowing her, she was one of the anchor at Kairali TV ( The Malayalam Communications Limited ) , Web Penetration in Kerala - Status Report &amp; Forecast by Aravind Jose, No Negative Day etc was some other sessions. Niju Mohan presented his experience on Tata Jagriti Yatra. Ajith Sam John a BTech student speaks about Social Media Recruitment. Its interesting to see he too recuits people to do work :). Kenny Jacob is going to getting married soon. May be the reason he came with Cultural Invasion Vs Social Evolution. Arun Basil Lal went with a session WordPress-ing It. He started with installation of wordpress, plugins, themes etc. Though these were the stuffs we do often, but there are people who don&#8217;t know how to install it. I think it was very useful for those people and hope they will explore wordpress. Its really nice to see Engineering Students active in Barcamps. The last session was by Binny V A launching the product  eNGO.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4484449720/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4484449720_a15ea94ddb.jpg" alt="8th Barcamp Kerala at MACFAST" /></a>  A snapshot from BCK8 . Photo credits to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/aravindjose/BCK8">Aravind Jose</a>  The lunch and evenining tea was provided by the college. The food was so delicious. We all enjoyed the lunch and tea made some conversations with the Principal Father Abraham Mulamootil. He was also an active attendee and its nice to see such a college and Principal. The college provide internet facility 24 X 7 for the students. When I was at CUIET doing my BTech ( 2003-2007 ), our lab was not open 24 X 7 or we was not having full time internet facility. But its really nice to see colleges like MACFAST and a good principal who motivates his students. Motivation is a key factor that makes a professional. If it lags then its something like schooling than doing BTech as a professional Degree . So the campus needs such colleges, lectures , pricipals to make a better next generation. So bye for now hoping to see you for the next Barcamp 9.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Even if you have Windows, sometimes you may be facing the same problem. You may need to check IE 6 , 7 , 8 . I used to work from GNU / Linux . But recently I came to a site which gives the live screenshots of the webpages in different operating systems with different browsers . This made me think how it works :) .  Yes its easy to implement it . You just need a Windows machine with IE6 , another with IE7 , and IE8 . So now it has 3 machines with 3 IE versions . You can either login to the other machine using the remote desktop and check the browser compatibility there .  This is also a cheapest way to reduce the cost of developement according to me . By this way every one can login to their GNU/Linux machine and login to remote desktop to test the IE versions . Windows 7 comes with some , and I have heard that there is some softwares also to make IE 6, 7, 8 work on a single machine . But I am not much aware of  the softwares as I don&#8217;t have a Windows running in mine <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I welcome any of the windows users to come and contribute to this . I will be much more happier to hear from you . You can write the comments <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> and let me know what you think .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are some of the PHP and MySQL question that you cannot avoid .  First of all let&#8217;s make a guess how strong you are  1 ) How strong are you in PHP? ( out of 10  )  2 ) How strong are you in MySQL ?  3 ) How strong are you in OOP&#8217;s ?  So you answered the 3 questions . So lets move on to test whether you are right or wrong <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  1 ) What will you use to initialize a string ? ie with single quotes or double quotes ?  2 ) You have a string &#8220;hi all, I said hello&#8221; . You want to replace the occourence of hi with hello and hello with hi . What will you do ?  3 ) What&#8217;s the difference between PHP4 and PHP5 ?  4 ) What&#8217;s all added in PHP 5.3 ?  5 ) What&#8217;s Name spacing ?  6 ) What are the types of inheritance PHP supports ?  7 ) What do you mean by an Abstract class and Interface ?  8 ) When a file is uploaded to the sever how can you check whether its uploaded or not ?  9 ) How will you move the uploaded file to another location of server ?  10 ) What are the things that need to be checked before uploading a file ?  11 ) How will you connect mysql ?  12 ) Does PHP supports PDF creation ?  13 ) What are the storage types in MySQL ?  14 ) What is the difference between InnoDb and MyISAM ?  15 ) Does MyISAM supports relations ?  16 ) What&#8217;s indexing ?  17 ) MySQL is case sensitive or case insensitive ?  18 ) You have a table say user with field name and data&#8217;s Lokam , loker , lover , Lough , Lost , Enough , Elephant etc . Write a query which gives all the terms Lokam , loker , lover , Lough and Lost .  19 ) Now you want to select only the loker , lover . What will you add to get this result ?  20 ) Let there is table user with name and marks . How will you select the second largest number from this table ?  For eg let the data&#8217;s are  hari 23 , jenson 10 , ruby 20 , rijith 10 . You want to select 20 from this <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  21 ) What are the different types of JOINS ?  22 ) What is LEFT , RIGHT , INNER joins ?  23 ) Have you used Triggers ? What is it ?  24 ) What is Views in MySQL ?  25 ) Have you written procedures ? How can you write a procedure in MySQL ?  26 ) How can you call a mysql procedure from PHP ?  27 ) What is MVC ? ( If you are strong in any frameworks , then questions from that can also be hit, don&#8217;t make it a miss rate :) )  28 ) Does PHP has an XML library ? Is it comming as default ?  29 ) What&#8217;s SOAP ?  30 ) What&#8217;s is XSS attack ?  31 ) What&#8217;s the difference between htmlspecialchars and htmlentities ?  32 ) What is Session and Cookie ?  33 ) What&#8217;s the difference between session_register and $_SESSION ?  34 ) What is magic quotes ? Is it on or off by default in PHP 5 ?  35 ) What does __sleep and __wake do ?  36 ) Can you submit a form with out a submit button ?  37 ) How can you set a cookie to expire after 30 minutes or so ?  Do you answered all the above questions ?  Great then you got 8 out of 10 . This is just a beginning . Still a long way to go <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . These are some of the questions that are commonly asked by any developers for an interview . I will be adding more soon . But now I can recall upto this . I welcome each and every ones contribution to make this much more better .  This is just PHP and MySQL questions . Javascript and Ajax can do more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . I meant about jQuery , Dojo , Prototype , Mootools etc .</p>

Oh no just considering India ( my country ) itself there are lots of languages ( More than the number of states itself <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) . I don&#8217;t know every language too . Google has recently came with a desktop application which currently translate from 14 different languages - Arabic, Bengali, Farsi (Persian), Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.  Some of the fatures are  1 ) Offline Support : You don&#8217;t need an internet connection.  2 ) Word Completions : Dictionary based word completions for prefixes.  3 ) Personalized Choices : Remember user corrections for personalized service.  4 ) Easy Keyboard : Dictionary enabled keyboard to enter rare and complex words.  5 ) Quick Search : Single click web search for highlighted word.  6 ) Cool Customization : Customize suggestions page size, display font and more.  The thing is its only available for windows <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I have not tried the application , but you guys can have a try . You can get it from <a href="http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/">http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/</a>   You can also use the online version http://www.google.com/transliterate/ which can convert from english to different languages like malayalam , hindi , urudu , nepali , punjabi , arabic , kannada , tamil etc . The image shown above is developed with the help of gimp and google transliterate tool .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one will be eager to know whether the mail send by you has been read or not by him/her <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( Especailly love letters , email campaigns , news letters etc ) right ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4410492336/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4410492336_c7b6ec185c_o.jpg" alt="Did he / she read my mail ?" /></a>  Today I would love to share with you how you can track this . I am not going to write any code. But will go through how you can acheive this . I hope you are a web-developer or know something about programming in PHP .  I am going through some of the functions in PHP . There will be similar functions in .NET too . The <a href="http://harikt.com/content/swiftmailer-powerful-php-mailer-library">swiftmailer</a> already have a function to send whether the mail is opened or not . But it will ask the user the permission before sending it .  I am going through a different one . Every one knows the mail function . Either we can use the php mail or swiftmailer or phpmailer or Zend_Mail any to send mails . Its easy to send mails with Swiftmailer . Now we need to get the confirmation for the mail send right ?  We all know its easy to create dynamic images with the PHP GD library . Every one would have created it for captcha images right ? . So we need to write some PHP code to create a dynamic image . So the link will be something like http://example.com/mygd-image.php which will output an image . If we are sending to a single person we don&#8217;t need to pass values using GET . ie <a href="http://example.com/mygd-image.php?openedBy=5467">http://example.com/mygd-image.php?openedBy=5467</a> . But when its for email campaigns and all we need a way to track which person has opened the mail . We will be having the names of the users and corresponding key ( I mean primary key or we can create a hash based on the mail or something different according to your logic ) . We just need to pass that to the link which creates the image . Track it using the PHP GET method and update the database . Yes now you know whether the mail is opened or not .  There is also a possibility that the images will be blocked . The reason why the images is blocked is due to these type of things which will be used for bad also . For eg : spammers can check whether the email address is faque or not using just sending these sort of mails . So when you open the mail and the image loads it confirms your email address . So gmail usually blocks these type of images .  The image is taken from the flickr photostream of Davide Restivo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/somemixedstuff/">http://www.flickr.com/people/somemixedstuff/</a> ( Thanks and credits for the image to him ) . I hope I have not missed any  . You can look the php gd library for how to create dynamic images . The mail functions and your favourite php library to send mails . Thanks guys . That&#8217;s all for today . Enjoy .</p>

The image is got from a google search ( Thanks to <a href="http://laughingsquid.com">http://laughingsquid.com</a> ) and I made some edits <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( not much ) .  What will make this Barcamp awesome is the speech by Shwetank Dixit . He was one of the speaker previously in the Barcamp which was held at Technopark ( I think it was BCK5 ) . If you are a web-developer who works on server side languages like PHP , Pearl , Python , .NET or any or a designer who converts PSD to XHTML or moving to HTML5 , then you will defnitely love this .  Ya there are other speakers too that I love to hear . I am not going into all who are taking those sessions , its not becuase I don&#8217;t love to write here , but its already there ;) . Catch it from <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/</a> . Be part of the awesome Barcamp held at Kerala .  <del>I am also planning to take a session. But I am not sure whether I want to go with it or not as I have not mastered it . Anyway if I get some time making some slides or prepare some I will go for a session . Let&#8217;s wait and see , the date is on 28th , so some more days for me to prepare .</del> You can see the updated post about the <a href="http://harikt.com/content/looking-back-barcamp-8-mar-athanasios-college-advanced-studies-macfast">BC8 here</a> :).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first symfony workshop was on 13th ( brought qaeet application ) and the second was conducted on 21st sunday at Techjini office Bangalore . I was one among them in the waiting list in phpmeetup, but as I attended the first meetup I got the permission to be part of the second one . I travelled around 680 Km by train ( 12 hours of journey from Ernakulam to Bangalore and vice versa ) to be part of the symfony workshop in Bangalore . I was really wondering why the guys who have RSVP ed yes didnot looked so seriously to attend it . Sjoerd De Jong also have send mails to all the users in the group about RSVP ing only if they are able to come . If the guys have RSVP ed no some others was able to be part of it. The strength was only 5 ( Elvisds called one of his friend who was interested to be part of the event ) this time ( 12 guys was unable to attend as the other 12 guys RSVP ed yes <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ).  Anyway the second workshop was also a wonderful one . Sjoerd&#8217;s system broke ( lol poor windows ) and he was using my system with Ubuntu 9.10 , Netbeans 6.8 , svn and some other tools . He shows the power of symfony routing with an example , symfony admin-generator , some ajax . As I want to catch my train around 5:00 PM and some others also was leaving, Sjoerd winded up the event . But it was really an awesome one . I know my posts are becoming too late . But the thing is that I am little busy with Book reviews and all .  I have uploaded the application to github . Feel free to look into the code and learn symfony. Though I have named the application as jobeet its not the jobeet tutorial . These are some of the things that we have done on the 2nd meetup . <a href="http://github.com/harikt/jobeet">http://github.com/harikt/jobeet</a> . Sjoerd also recommends you to look Symfony 2 if you are not looking to develop a project with symfony in the short time for its really a new improved code base which will be published completely in the late 2010 . You can look into the site <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/">http://symfony-reloaded.org/</a> .  Note : A help to those who are searching or looking for Bus number from Bangalore City Railway station ( Majestic ) to J P Nagar 2nd (second ) phase, 24th Main . You can get the bus from the 11th platform and catch buses numbered 2 ( 2A , 2B etc) . The conductors will help you getting the proper place . ( This is from my past journey dated 21st Feb 2010 . Platform and bus numbers may change as time passes . So feel free to update me if any )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may be knowing that I was at Bangalore on February 13th to be part of the symfony workshop. I was little late ( late by 10 mins ) so I didnot looked for a hotel to have my break fast . The workshop was conducted by Sjoerd De Jong at Techjini office Bangalore. We developed a qaeet application ( Though I says its we, Sjoerd was the main person who was working on that . So full credits to him ). Though the strength of the people who have RSVP was 15 , some of them didnot attended the event ( May be due to some other personal reasons , but that makes a loss for the others who wished to come #fail ) . Anyway for the 2nd meetup if you guys who have RSVP ed yes and is not able to come or have changed your mind , please make the changes in the meetup site . That will be a great help to others who love to attend the session .  We were a total of 7 guys for the workshop . 3 were from Techjini itself . One the owner itslef Amith Rana and two other employees ( Amal and Amith ) . We have a great time developing the qaeet and discussing some other nice cool applications . Techjini guys was working in symfony for a long time , so they too have helped Sjoerd when some bugs occurs . We winded the session around 5 PM .  The source code of the qaeet application is at <a href="http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet">http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet</a> . I have requested Sjoerd to add a read me file which will be a great help to quickly understand . You can also watch the <a href="http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/">http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/</a> group, some times may be having the qaeet in the future .  Updated : If you are a symfony developer you will be defnitely knowing about the release of Symfony 2 which was at Symfony Live Paris event . Now its a developer preview release ( We can see the guys are excited to see what Symfony will give you ) . Symfony 2 will be available in the late 2010 . I was watching twitter and the symfony blog and got lots of information about the Paris event just finished . Symfony 2 will be using some of the components of Zend . The slides are available and is a good resource though we missed the talk given by them . Matthew Weier O&#8217;Phinney have given a talk about how to use of Zend components in symfony project . I also loved the presentation of Dustin Whittle of Yahoo . Yahoo uses symfony as a full stack framework ( Delicious , Yahoo answers etc ) . In his slide he has shown what Rasmus think about PHP framework and the bench mark of hello world application . Yes I too agree we don&#8217;t need a framework to write hello world . Hell with hello world bench mark for PHP frameworks .  I know every one have enjoyed the Symfony Live held in Paris . And lets wait to see the first release of Symfony 2 PHP framework in the late 2010 . Till then we can watch the symfony-reloaded.org.</p>
