  <div class="entry-content"><p>These are some of the PHP and MySQL question that you cannot avoid .  First of all let&#8217;s make a guess how strong you are  1 ) How strong are you in PHP? ( out of 10  )  2 ) How strong are you in MySQL ?  3 ) How strong are you in OOP&#8217;s ?  So you answered the 3 questions . So lets move on to test whether you are right or wrong <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  1 ) What will you use to initialize a string ? ie with single quotes or double quotes ?  2 ) You have a string &#8220;hi all, I said hello&#8221; . You want to replace the occourence of hi with hello and hello with hi . What will you do ?  3 ) What&#8217;s the difference between PHP4 and PHP5 ?  4 ) What&#8217;s all added in PHP 5.3 ?  5 ) What&#8217;s Name spacing ?  6 ) What are the types of inheritance PHP supports ?  7 ) What do you mean by an Abstract class and Interface ?  8 ) When a file is uploaded to the sever how can you check whether its uploaded or not ?  9 ) How will you move the uploaded file to another location of server ?  10 ) What are the things that need to be checked before uploading a file ?  11 ) How will you connect mysql ?  12 ) Does PHP supports PDF creation ?  13 ) What are the storage types in MySQL ?  14 ) What is the difference between InnoDb and MyISAM ?  15 ) Does MyISAM supports relations ?  16 ) What&#8217;s indexing ?  17 ) MySQL is case sensitive or case insensitive ?  18 ) You have a table say user with field name and data&#8217;s Lokam , loker , lover , Lough , Lost , Enough , Elephant etc . Write a query which gives all the terms Lokam , loker , lover , Lough and Lost .  19 ) Now you want to select only the loker , lover . What will you add to get this result ?  20 ) Let there is table user with name and marks . How will you select the second largest number from this table ?  For eg let the data&#8217;s are  hari 23 , jenson 10 , ruby 20 , rijith 10 . You want to select 20 from this <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> .  21 ) What are the different types of JOINS ?  22 ) What is LEFT , RIGHT , INNER joins ?  23 ) Have you used Triggers ? What is it ?  24 ) What is Views in MySQL ?  25 ) Have you written procedures ? How can you write a procedure in MySQL ?  26 ) How can you call a mysql procedure from PHP ?  27 ) What is MVC ? ( If you are strong in any frameworks , then questions from that can also be hit, don&#8217;t make it a miss rate :) )  28 ) Does PHP has an XML library ? Is it comming as default ?  29 ) What&#8217;s SOAP ?  30 ) What&#8217;s is XSS attack ?  31 ) What&#8217;s the difference between htmlspecialchars and htmlentities ?  32 ) What is Session and Cookie ?  33 ) What&#8217;s the difference between session_register and $_SESSION ?  34 ) What is magic quotes ? Is it on or off by default in PHP 5 ?  35 ) What does __sleep and __wake do ?  36 ) Can you submit a form with out a submit button ?  37 ) How can you set a cookie to expire after 30 minutes or so ?  Do you answered all the above questions ?  Great then you got 8 out of 10 . This is just a beginning . Still a long way to go <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . These are some of the questions that are commonly asked by any developers for an interview . I will be adding more soon . But now I can recall upto this . I welcome each and every ones contribution to make this much more better .  This is just PHP and MySQL questions . Javascript and Ajax can do more <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . I meant about jQuery , Dojo , Prototype , Mootools etc .</p>

Oh no just considering India ( my country ) itself there are lots of languages ( More than the number of states itself <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ) . I don&#8217;t know every language too . Google has recently came with a desktop application which currently translate from 14 different languages - Arabic, Bengali, Farsi (Persian), Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.  Some of the fatures are  1 ) Offline Support : You don&#8217;t need an internet connection.  2 ) Word Completions : Dictionary based word completions for prefixes.  3 ) Personalized Choices : Remember user corrections for personalized service.  4 ) Easy Keyboard : Dictionary enabled keyboard to enter rare and complex words.  5 ) Quick Search : Single click web search for highlighted word.  6 ) Cool Customization : Customize suggestions page size, display font and more.  The thing is its only available for windows <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/tounge_smile.gif" alt="image" /> . So I have not tried the application , but you guys can have a try . You can get it from <a href="http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/">http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/</a>   You can also use the online version http://www.google.com/transliterate/ which can convert from english to different languages like malayalam , hindi , urudu , nepali , punjabi , arabic , kannada , tamil etc . The image shown above is developed with the help of gimp and google transliterate tool .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every one will be eager to know whether the mail send by you has been read or not by him/her <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( Especailly love letters , email campaigns , news letters etc ) right ?  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4410492336/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4410492336_c7b6ec185c_o.jpg" alt="Did he / she read my mail ?" /></a>  Today I would love to share with you how you can track this . I am not going to write any code. But will go through how you can acheive this . I hope you are a web-developer or know something about programming in PHP .  I am going through some of the functions in PHP . There will be similar functions in .NET too . The <a href="http://harikt.com/content/swiftmailer-powerful-php-mailer-library">swiftmailer</a> already have a function to send whether the mail is opened or not . But it will ask the user the permission before sending it .  I am going through a different one . Every one knows the mail function . Either we can use the php mail or swiftmailer or phpmailer or Zend_Mail any to send mails . Its easy to send mails with Swiftmailer . Now we need to get the confirmation for the mail send right ?  We all know its easy to create dynamic images with the PHP GD library . Every one would have created it for captcha images right ? . So we need to write some PHP code to create a dynamic image . So the link will be something like http://example.com/mygd-image.php which will output an image . If we are sending to a single person we don&#8217;t need to pass values using GET . ie <a href="http://example.com/mygd-image.php?openedBy=5467">http://example.com/mygd-image.php?openedBy=5467</a> . But when its for email campaigns and all we need a way to track which person has opened the mail . We will be having the names of the users and corresponding key ( I mean primary key or we can create a hash based on the mail or something different according to your logic ) . We just need to pass that to the link which creates the image . Track it using the PHP GET method and update the database . Yes now you know whether the mail is opened or not .  There is also a possibility that the images will be blocked . The reason why the images is blocked is due to these type of things which will be used for bad also . For eg : spammers can check whether the email address is faque or not using just sending these sort of mails . So when you open the mail and the image loads it confirms your email address . So gmail usually blocks these type of images .  The image is taken from the flickr photostream of Davide Restivo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/somemixedstuff/">http://www.flickr.com/people/somemixedstuff/</a> ( Thanks and credits for the image to him ) . I hope I have not missed any  . You can look the php gd library for how to create dynamic images . The mail functions and your favourite php library to send mails . Thanks guys . That&#8217;s all for today . Enjoy .</p>

The image is got from a google search ( Thanks to <a href="http://laughingsquid.com">http://laughingsquid.com</a> ) and I made some edits <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/wink_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ( not much ) .  What will make this Barcamp awesome is the speech by Shwetank Dixit . He was one of the speaker previously in the Barcamp which was held at Technopark ( I think it was BCK5 ) . If you are a web-developer who works on server side languages like PHP , Pearl , Python , .NET or any or a designer who converts PSD to XHTML or moving to HTML5 , then you will defnitely love this .  Ya there are other speakers too that I love to hear . I am not going into all who are taking those sessions , its not becuase I don&#8217;t love to write here , but its already there ;) . Catch it from <a href="http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/">http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/sessions/</a> . Be part of the awesome Barcamp held at Kerala .  <del>I am also planning to take a session. But I am not sure whether I want to go with it or not as I have not mastered it . Anyway if I get some time making some slides or prepare some I will go for a session . Let&#8217;s wait and see , the date is on 28th , so some more days for me to prepare .</del> You can see the updated post about the <a href="http://harikt.com/content/looking-back-barcamp-8-mar-athanasios-college-advanced-studies-macfast">BC8 here</a> :).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first symfony workshop was on 13th ( brought qaeet application ) and the second was conducted on 21st sunday at Techjini office Bangalore . I was one among them in the waiting list in phpmeetup, but as I attended the first meetup I got the permission to be part of the second one . I travelled around 680 Km by train ( 12 hours of journey from Ernakulam to Bangalore and vice versa ) to be part of the symfony workshop in Bangalore . I was really wondering why the guys who have RSVP ed yes didnot looked so seriously to attend it . Sjoerd De Jong also have send mails to all the users in the group about RSVP ing only if they are able to come . If the guys have RSVP ed no some others was able to be part of it. The strength was only 5 ( Elvisds called one of his friend who was interested to be part of the event ) this time ( 12 guys was unable to attend as the other 12 guys RSVP ed yes <img src="http://harikt.com/sites/all/libraries/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angry_smile.gif" alt="image" /> ).  Anyway the second workshop was also a wonderful one . Sjoerd&#8217;s system broke ( lol poor windows ) and he was using my system with Ubuntu 9.10 , Netbeans 6.8 , svn and some other tools . He shows the power of symfony routing with an example , symfony admin-generator , some ajax . As I want to catch my train around 5:00 PM and some others also was leaving, Sjoerd winded up the event . But it was really an awesome one . I know my posts are becoming too late . But the thing is that I am little busy with Book reviews and all .  I have uploaded the application to github . Feel free to look into the code and learn symfony. Though I have named the application as jobeet its not the jobeet tutorial . These are some of the things that we have done on the 2nd meetup . <a href="http://github.com/harikt/jobeet">http://github.com/harikt/jobeet</a> . Sjoerd also recommends you to look Symfony 2 if you are not looking to develop a project with symfony in the short time for its really a new improved code base which will be published completely in the late 2010 . You can look into the site <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/">http://symfony-reloaded.org/</a> .  Note : A help to those who are searching or looking for Bus number from Bangalore City Railway station ( Majestic ) to J P Nagar 2nd (second ) phase, 24th Main . You can get the bus from the 11th platform and catch buses numbered 2 ( 2A , 2B etc) . The conductors will help you getting the proper place . ( This is from my past journey dated 21st Feb 2010 . Platform and bus numbers may change as time passes . So feel free to update me if any )</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may be knowing that I was at Bangalore on February 13th to be part of the symfony workshop. I was little late ( late by 10 mins ) so I didnot looked for a hotel to have my break fast . The workshop was conducted by Sjoerd De Jong at Techjini office Bangalore. We developed a qaeet application ( Though I says its we, Sjoerd was the main person who was working on that . So full credits to him ). Though the strength of the people who have RSVP was 15 , some of them didnot attended the event ( May be due to some other personal reasons , but that makes a loss for the others who wished to come #fail ) . Anyway for the 2nd meetup if you guys who have RSVP ed yes and is not able to come or have changed your mind , please make the changes in the meetup site . That will be a great help to others who love to attend the session .  We were a total of 7 guys for the workshop . 3 were from Techjini itself . One the owner itslef Amith Rana and two other employees ( Amal and Amith ) . We have a great time developing the qaeet and discussing some other nice cool applications . Techjini guys was working in symfony for a long time , so they too have helped Sjoerd when some bugs occurs . We winded the session around 5 PM .  The source code of the qaeet application is at <a href="http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet">http://github.com/symfony-bangalore/qaeet</a> . I have requested Sjoerd to add a read me file which will be a great help to quickly understand . You can also watch the <a href="http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/">http://www.symfony-bangalore.org/</a> group, some times may be having the qaeet in the future .  Updated : If you are a symfony developer you will be defnitely knowing about the release of Symfony 2 which was at Symfony Live Paris event . Now its a developer preview release ( We can see the guys are excited to see what Symfony will give you ) . Symfony 2 will be available in the late 2010 . I was watching twitter and the symfony blog and got lots of information about the Paris event just finished . Symfony 2 will be using some of the components of Zend . The slides are available and is a good resource though we missed the talk given by them . Matthew Weier O&#8217;Phinney have given a talk about how to use of Zend components in symfony project . I also loved the presentation of Dustin Whittle of Yahoo . Yahoo uses symfony as a full stack framework ( Delicious , Yahoo answers etc ) . In his slide he has shown what Rasmus think about PHP framework and the bench mark of hello world application . Yes I too agree we don&#8217;t need a framework to write hello world . Hell with hello world bench mark for PHP frameworks .  I know every one have enjoyed the Symfony Live held in Paris . And lets wait to see the first release of Symfony 2 PHP framework in the late 2010 . Till then we can watch the symfony-reloaded.org.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I have missed to post lots of nice applications. You may be aware or may not be . Anyway this is really interesting one to every one. I hope every one is using twitter or you may have atleast heard about twitter . I am really addicted to twitter the micro blogging client . Twitter may be one reason that makes me lasy to post long description blog posts .  These are some of the things that twitter misses , or we all love to see in twitter .  1 ) Updating the tweets quickly : Now we need to refresh the page manually or you may be using a twitter client like choqok or tweetdeck or some other. We can use one jquery based twitter client which can be used in websites to show the recent tweets from you or your favourite terms . Yes juitter a javascript tool will do the work . You just need to download the scripts and do the necessary things .  Eg :  Download the script from http://www.juitter.com/  &lt;code>  <script language="javascript" src="/js/jquery-1.3.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"\>&lt;/script> <script language="javascript" src="/js/jquery.juitter.js" type="text/javascript"\>&lt;/script> <script language="javascript" src="/js/system.js" type="text/javascript"\>&lt;/script>  &lt;/code>  The system.js files contains the configuration . Not much just a few lines  &lt;code>  $(document).ready(function() {     $.Juitter.start({         searchType:"fromUser",         searchObject:"harikt",         lang:"en",         live:"live-15",         placeHolder:"juitterContainer",         loadMSG: "Loading messages...",         imgName: "loader.gif",         total: 20,         readMore: "Read it on Twitter",         nameUser:"image"     }); );  &lt;/code>  The place holder is where the tweets will be showing . ie <div id="juitterContainer"\>&lt;/div> now shows the twitter feeds which you have given as the search term .  I noticed this wonderful tool after following the lithium php framework . Have already written about the new born rapidly growing framework . You can <a href="http://harikt.com/node/120">read about lithium over here</a> . You can go and look the demo at http://www.juitter.com/ .  2 ) Retweet button : Every site owner will be trying to increase the amount of visitors to their website . Twitter brings some visitors to your website too. So why not keeping a retweet button . Yes John Resig ( the author of jquery , employee at Mozilla and much more ....) has developed a retweet button . Its easier than the tweetme button . Will be send directly to twitter website . You can see the sample and use the code located at http://ejohn.org/blog/retweet/  These two applications uses jquery .

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started learning symfony after some of my experiments with zend framework and others . So I think I want to write something about the symfony live conference which will be held on February 15 to 17th of 2010 .  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4323132806/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4323132806_78a0d70d8e.jpg" alt="symfony live conference" /></a>  Be part of the symfony live 2010 as symfony 2 will be revealed . There are lots of sessions by core players of git , zend , doctrine etc . Get more information about schedule from http://www.symfony-live.com/schedule .  Symfony project is supported by sensio labs . The lead developer and owner of symfony framework . Awesome community supported project . Available in MIT licence. Lots of other stand alone components are available for php developers from symfony. YAML , Dependency injection ,Templating , Event Dispatcher, Request handler etc.  Why I started learning symfony ?  Some of you may be interested to know why I started to learn symfony . After recognising the beneficts of MVC I thought of learning an open-source MVC framework. Though I was interested to learn symfony I was forced to move with Zend . Though it is documented , some one who comes without much knowledge of MVC will be weired. It was missing a good example .  Though I developed a sample application I was not feeling much comfortable to work with zend. And at that time I came to know about the presentation by Fabien Potentier &#8220;using symfony and zend&#8221; . Many people tried to convince me about the beneficts moving with zend for zend is the PHP company . But if you are not comfortable enough then I think its not good to go with that right ? ( Especially when there is none to help you ).  I was interested to see the auto generation of codes by symfony. I am a GNU/Linux user, so I used to work on command line. Working with symfony is really awesome . If you are a command line guy then you too will defnitely love symfony. Recently I came to know about the PHP bangalore users meet up was having a framework shootout . I would have been there if I was in Bangalore. But I missed that too . If anyone missed that session there is one more chance to get trained with symfony . Yes there is a new symfony bangalore group started http://www.symfony-bangalore.org .  You can get more information from http://www.symfony-project.org/ about the symfony project.  Stand alone components are available from http://components.symfony-project.org/ .  You will be hearing about lots of interesting open-source projects like swift-mailer , doctrine , twig etc .  I may be using zend components in the future, but anyway not now ;) .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I heard about Pranav Mistry from one of my friend Prajith . Though I saw the video I didnot get much time to write about that . I don&#8217;t know whether every one may have heard about him too. Let me keep those two awesome videos .  I hope you too enjoyed it . And I am very happy to hear and tell you that he puts all as opensource . Does any one do like that ?  I am not keeping all the links to his projects .

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harikt/4294304881/" title="opensource_logo by K T Hari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4294304881_87b173eb57_t.jpg" alt="opensource_logo" /></a>Recently I was arguing with one of my friend over the beneficts of opensource frameworks over custom . I know there may be lots of posts describing the beneficts and drawbacks . But I just thought of writing it as I can say I have written about that in my blog. You can check it out .  I hope every one knows about <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">opensource</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">licences</a> . I have been using and learning some of the most popular opensource frameworks like zend, lithium , drupal etc . So lets move on to what are the beneficts I feel .  Beneficts of open source :  1 ) Mainly community supported .  2 ) Coding standards will be followed .  3 ) Throughly tested and immediate patches will be available if any thing breaks .  4 ) Can get quick help from the community .  5 ) Flexible for maintaince ( ie not throw away prototyping )  6 ) Many do unit testing using the popular test tools like phpunit , simpletest etc .  Beneficts of custom :  1 ) Custom frameworks may be good for a developer as he knows what he has written . I don&#8217;t think there is much beneficts for users .  Drawbacks of custom frameworks :  1 ) It will be developed by a single or some group of people.  2 ) May be tested by some group of peoples , but lacks the tests done by community ( mass of people )  3 ) Developing from scratch is not a big deal , but maintainence is the one that&#8217;s costly than development . When its custom made , you may need to get the exact people for that . Else its like &#8220;too many cooks spoil the broothe&#8221;. Pretty enough community developers, so not a big deal to get one.  4 ) May or may not be flexible . For example lets compare with drupal . When you starts your project , you may have thought just a small blog , then later you thought of having forums , after that you thought you need to sell some goods.  When its drupal like framework , its easy as you just need to maintain the common code base which comes with much of the features and some other contributed and custom modules will make everything fine . But when its custom , you may need to mess with the code , or may need to go extending it , which is not so easy like drupal or any other .  These are what I feel for now . May be more points , but for the time I am not remebering it . If any one feels I missed any , please add your comments I will update it .</p>
